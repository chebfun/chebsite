What is Chebfun?
====

The mathematical basis of Chebfun is piecewise polynomial interpolation
implemented with what we call "Chebyshev technology". The foundations are
described, with Chebfun examples, in [Approximation Theory and Approximation
Practice][atap]. Chebfun has extensive capabilities for dealing with linear
and nonlinear differential and integral operators, and it also includes
continuous analogues of linear algebra notions like QR and singular value
decomposition. The [Chebfun2][chebfun2] extension works with functions of two
variables defined on a rectangle in the x-y plane.  To get a sense of the
breadth and power of Chebfun, a great place to start is by looking at our
<Examples>.
