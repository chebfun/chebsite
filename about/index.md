What is Chebfun?
====

Chebfun is an open-source software system for numerical computing with
functions. The mathematical basis of Chebfun is piecewise polynomial
interpolation implemented with what we call “Chebyshev technology”. The
foundations are described, with Chebfun examples, in _[Approximation Theory and
Approximation Practice](../ATAP/)_. Chebfun has extensive capabilities for dealing with
linear and nonlinear differential and integral operators, and it also includes
continuous analogues of linear algebra notions like QR and singular value
decomposition. The [Chebfun2](../docs/guide/guide11.html) extension works with
functions of two variables defined on a rectangle in the $x$-$y$ plane. To get
a sense of the breadth and power of Chebfun, a great place to start is by
looking at our [Examples](../examples).
