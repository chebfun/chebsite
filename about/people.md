    <h3>Anthony Austin</h3>
    Anthony Austin started as a DPhil student at Oxford in 2012. When not
    doing research related to contour integrals, large-scale linear algebra,
    and rational approximation, he is our code guru, keeping us honest with
    object-oriented programming and Git. After Nick Hale, he is the team
    member responsible for the most lines of code in Chebfun v5.

    <h3>Zachary Battles</h3>
    Zachary Battles was a Rhodes Scholar and DPhil student from 2002 to 2005,
    and he wrote Chebfun version 1.  It has hard to believe it was just a few
    hundred lines of code!  Zachary introduced the recursive rootfinding
    algorithm in ROOTS as well as commands such as QR, SVD, \, RANK and COND
    for quasimatrices.

    <h3>&#193;sgeir Birkisson</h3>
    Asgeir Birkisson was an MSc and then DPhil student at Oxford from 2008 to
    2014.  With Toby Driscoll he introduced automatic differentiation into
    Chebfun and thus enabled us to solve nonlinear differential equations.  He
    also wrote CHEBGUI.

    <h3>Toby Driscoll</h3>
    Toby Driscoll, a professor at the University of Delaware, created the ODE
    and integral equations side of Chebfun starting in 2008 and has been one
    of the leaders of the Chebfun project since then. Among other codes he is
    responsible for SOLVEBVP, EIGS, EXPM, VOLT, and FRED.  He has also led
    Chebfun's movement to more advanced linear and nonlinear block structures.

    well as developing many algorithms related to solution of ODEs and PDEs
    (with Driscoll and Birkisson, including PDE15S) and fast quadrature and
    orthogonal expansions (with Townsend, including SUM, LEGPTS, CHEB2LEG, and
    CONV).  He was director of the Chebfun project from 2010 to 2014 and
    managed the creation of Chebfun version 5.

    Rodrigo Platte, Chebfun team member #4, was a postdoc at Oxford from 2007
    to 2009 and worked with Ricardo Pachon to produce Chebfun version 2.
    Rodrigo extended Chebfun to infinite intervals and invented the fast edge
    detection algorithm used by the Chebfun constructor in "splitting on"
    mode.

+ **Jean-Paul Berrut**, a professor at the University of Fribourg, has been a
  tireless advocate of the power of barycentric formulas for polynomial
  interpolation.  That was the idea that originally led to Chebfun.

+ **Folkmar Bornemann**, a professor at the Technical University of Munich,
  proposed the lazy evaluation idea that enabled Chebfun to represent linear
  operators and thereby solve ODEs.

+ **Yuji Nakatsukasa**, now at the University of Tokyo, worked with Vanni
  Noferini and Alex Townsend on the fast rootfinding algorithms for Chebfun2.

+ **Vanni Noferini**, a postdoc at the University of Manchester, worked with
  Alex Townsend and Yuji Nakatsukasa on the fast rootfinding algorithms for
  Chebfun2.

+ **Sheehan Olver**, now at the University of Sydney, was a Junior Research
  Fellow at Oxford from 2007 to 2011.  He and Alex Townsend created the
  ultrapherical spectral methods for ODEs introduced in Chebfun version 5.

+ **Joris Van Deun** spent three months with the Chebfun team in 2010. He
  wrote the code CF for Caratheodory-Fejer approximation.

+ **Marcus Webb** spent six months with the Chebfun team at the end of his
  undergraduate studies at Oxford in 2012. He showed how Chebfun can be used
  for analytic continuation in the complex plane and improved BARY.
