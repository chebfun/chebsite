Join the Chebfun mailing list to get announcements of new developments.  We aim for about one message a month; you will not be spammed.

The mailing list is hosted as a Google group named chebfun-announce.  If you
have a Google account, click [here][subscribelink] to join.  Note that you may
need to login to your Google account first for this link to work.

If you don't have a Google account, you can still join, though it requires a
little more effort.  As of December 2015, you can do it like this:

1. Send a blank e-mail to [chebfun-announce+subscribe@googlegroups.com][subscribeemail].

2. Respond to the confirmation e-mail you then receive with a further blank
message.

Thanks from the Chebfun team, and remember that you can always contact us with
questions or suggestions at [help@chebfun.org][help].
