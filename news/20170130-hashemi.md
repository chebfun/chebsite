    Farewell to Behnam ("Chebfun3") Hashemi!
---

Tonight the Chebfun team gathered to say au revoir
to Behnam Hashemi, who is taking up a faculty position
in the Department of Mathematics at the
Shiraz University of Technology. Behnam wrote 
Chebfun3 single-handedly, about 10 thousand lines of code,
and we will miss him!
