    Farewell to one of our longstanding team members!

The Chebfun team gathered together last night to wish good luck to &#193;sgeir
Birkisson, who is moving on after seven years at Oxford as an MSc student,
DPhil student, and postdoc.  Chebfun's capabilities at solving ODEs are very
largely due to &#193;sgeir together with Nick Hale and Toby Driscoll.  He wrote
the Automatic Differentiation code for Newton iterations in the continuous
setting, the linearity detector, the CHEBGUI interface, the extension of
"backslash" to IVPs via automated conversion of higher-order equations to
first-order form, FOLLOWPATH, and much more.  Best wishes for the future,
&#193;sgeir!
