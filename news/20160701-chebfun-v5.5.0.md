    Release notes for v5.5.0, including Chebfun3
---

The Chebfun team is pleased to announce the release of Chebfun v5.5.0.  This
release introduces Chebfun3 for computation in a 3D box, due to Behnam Hashemi.
To learn about Chebfun3 see the [users guide][guide] and the
[examples][examples]. To get the new version, go to the 
[download page][download] or [GitHub][github].

Chebfun v5.5.0 also offers SPIN3 for stiff PDEs in 3D, SUMDISK for integrating
bivariate functions over a disk, and EXPLAIN for seeing in detail how the
Chebfun constructor chops a Chebyshev series.

We hope you enjoy the new release.  Feel free to post any questions or comments
to the Chebfun users' group [chebfun-users][chebfun-users].
