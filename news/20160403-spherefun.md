A new part of Chebfun has just been merged into the development branch,
available from the Chebfun [GitHub page](https://github.com/chebfun/chebfun):
`spherefun`, for computing with functions on the unit sphere.  `spherefun` is
the work of Alex Townsend, Heather Wilber, and Grady Wright and is described in
[Chapter 17](../docs/guide/guide17.html) of the Chebfun Guide.  `spherefun`
will become part of standard Chebfun in the next release, which we aim to put
out in a month or two.
