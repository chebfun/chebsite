The Chebfun team plans to host our first Chebfun User's Day on March 17, 2015
at the beautiful new Andrew Wiles Building of Oxford University.  If you are a
Chebfun user, please come prepared to show us a bit of what you are up to, and
bring any questions.  We will also show off some recently developed Chebfun
features.

There is no charge for this event, and the details of the schedule have not
yet been organized.  Please send a message before January 19, 2015 to
[help@chebfun.org][help] if you are likely to attend and wish to be put on our
mailing list.  Feel free to add further information such as the parts of
Chebfun of greatest interest to you and how much experience you have in using
it.
