snip: Today, we have merged the development and master branches on GitHub.

As part of a switch to a new rolling release model, the master and development
Chebfun branches have been merged on GitHub, and the default branch has been
switched to master. From now on, all contributions should be made by branching
directly off the master branch and pull requests should have the master branch
as the base. We believe that this change will make the latest features and bug
fixes more accessible.
