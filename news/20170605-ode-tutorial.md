snip: Tutorial article on Chebfun ODE discretizations

---

An article describing Chebfun's discretizations of ODE
boundary-value problems has been published in the Education
section of SIAM Review: J. L. Aurentz and L. N. Trefethen, Block
operators and spectral discretizations, SIAM Review 59 (2017),
pp. 423-446.  The article presents a sequence of 12 examples
illustrating how such problems can be solved with the codes
diffmat, intmat, diffrow, introw, cumsummat, and gridsample.
Chebfun uses the same vectors and matrices constructed by
these codes wrapped up in an automatic grid-refinement scheme.
