There were three Chebfun-related talks at the SIAM Annual Meeting
in Boston last week. Nick Trefethen spoke on "Chopping a Chebyshev series"
(joint work with Jared Aurentz), Alex Townsend spoke on
"Computing without spherical harmonics" (joint work with Grady
Wright and Heather Wilber), and Heather Wilber (below) spoke
on "Numerical computing in polar and spherical geometries"
(joint work with Wright and Townsend).  There was also an
informal demonstration by Trefethen of Chebfun3 (joint work
with Behnam Hashemi).
