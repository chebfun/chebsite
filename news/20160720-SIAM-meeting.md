There were two Chebfun-related talks at the SIAM Annual Meeting in Boston last
week.  Nick Trefethen spoke on "Chopping a Chebyshev series" (joint work with
Jared Aurentz), and Heather Wilber (depicted below) spoke on "Numerical
computing in polar and spherical geometries" (joint work with Grady Wright and
Alex Townsend).  There was also an informal demonstration by Trefethen of
Chebfun3 (joint work with Behnam Hashemi).
