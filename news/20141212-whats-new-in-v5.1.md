We are pleased to announce the release of Chebfun Version
5.1 for numerical computing with 1D and 2D functions.
The main new features are:

* Fast solution of ODE initial-value problems via "\"
  (see [Chebfun Guide, Chapter 10][guide10])
* Updated CHEBGUI interface for ODE, PDE, and eigenvalues
* New "trig" capabilities for periodic functions and ODEs
  (see [Chebfun Guide, Chapter 11][guide11])
* New function collections gallery, gallerytrig, gallery2
  (see [Chebfun Guide, Section 1.8][guide01])

Also note these new developments:

* Rewritten [Chapter 10][guide10] of the Chebfun Guide discusses ODE IVPs
* New [Chapter 11][guide11] of the Chebfun Guide for periodic functions
* Chebfun now has [an active wiki][githubwiki] on its GitHub page
* [Chebfun User's Day][usersday] will take place on 17 March at Oxford

There are a number of new Examples in the collection which demonstrate
the use of new features. Among them are the following:

* Galleries: [Gallery and Gallerytrig](../examples/approx/Galleries.html)
* IVPs: [Pythagorean planets](../examples/ode-nonlin/ThreePlanets.html)
 &middot; [Modelling infectious disease outbreaks](../examples/ode-nonlin/ModellingDiseases.html)
* Periodic functions: [Fourier spectral collocation](../examples/ode-linear/FourierCollocation.html)
 &middot; [Nonlinear periodic ODE](../examples/ode-nonlin/FourierCollocationNonLin.html)
 &middot; [A periodic ODE system](../examples/ode-linear/PeriodicSystem.html)
 &middot; [Time-dependent PDEs on a periodic interval with EXPM](../examples/ode-eig/FourierEigs.html)
 &middot; [Periodic ODE eigenvalue problems](../examples/pde/FourierExpm.html)
