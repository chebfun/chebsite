The Chebfun team is pleased to announce the release of Chebfun v5.4.0.
This version comes with two major new features:

 * __SPHEREFUN FOR COMPUTING WITH FUNCTIONS ON THE UNIT SPHERE__

     See [Chapter 17][guide17] of the Chebfun Guide.  Spherefun was written by
     Alex Townsend, Heather Wilber, and Grady Wright.

 * __SPIN/SPIN2 FOR SOLVING STIFF TIME-DEPENDENT PDES IN 1D/2D__

     See [Chapter 19][guide19] of the Chebfun Guide and the new [KdV][KdV],
     [Kuramoto-Sivashinsky][KS], [Gray-Scott][GS], and complex
     [Ginzburg-Landau][GL] entries in the examples collection.  SPIN and SPIN2
     were written by Hadrien Montanelli based on the ETDRK4 exponential
     integrator formula of Cox and Matthews.  To give them a try, it's enough
     to type e.g. `spin('kdv')` or `spin2('gl2')`.

In the coming weeks, we also plan to release CHEBFUN3 for computing with
functions in three dimensions and SPIN3 for stiff time-dependent PDEs in
3D.

We hope you enjoy the new release.  Feel free to post any questions or comments
to the Chebfun users' group [chebfun-users][chebfun-users].
