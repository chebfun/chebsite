    Release notes for v5.7.0, including Spinsphere
---

The Chebfun team is pleased to announce the release of Chebfun
v5.7.0 for numerical computing with functions in 1D, 2D, and 3D,
available at <http://www.chebfun.org> or <https://github.com/chebfun/chebfun>.
The new release includes three major new capabilities:

* SPINSPHERE for reaction-diffusion equations on the sphere

* MINIMAX, most powerful code available for best rational approximation

* RANDNFUN/2/SPHERE/DISK for generating random functions


The random function come with a new section of examples of
random ODEs at our web site http://www.chebfun.org.
In addition there are some other notable changes in Chebfun:

* Vectorization now allows f * g instead of f .* g, etc.

* PLOTCOEFFS has a new look and feel

* ZEBRA option for black/white plots in 2D or on the sphere

* ROOTS now computes zero curves in 2D to high accuracy

* L - lambda*eye(L) and other algebra for chebops

* L' as an alternative to ADJOINT(L)

* ROTATE for fast rotation of a spherefun (exploiting fast NUFFT)

* ARROWPLOT for putting arrowheads on planar trajectories

* Updated class diagram
