One of Chebfun's very appealing features is its `fov` command for computing the field of
values of a matrix.  An extensive new computational by Michael Overton of NYU has called
`fov` about 250 million times in its exploration of the Crouzeix conjecture.  See the 
final paragraph of <https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.14176>.
