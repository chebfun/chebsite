There will be a minisymposium titled "Solving ODEs and PDEs in Chebfun" at the
British Applied Mathematics Colloquium, to be held in Oxford on April 5, 2016.

**Abstract**: We believe that Chebfun is the most convenient tool available for
solving ODE initial- and boundary-value problems.  This minisymposium will
survey Chebun's methods and capabilities and present many applications.
Chebfun runs in MATLAB and can be downloaded freely from
[www.chebfun.org](http://www.chebfun.org).  Together with others on the Chebfun
team, its ODE/PDE capabilities are especially due to Toby Driscoll, Nick Hale,
and Asgeir Birkisson.

**Speakers**:

 * Nick Trefethen, University of Oxford:<br />
   _ODE IVPs/BVPs and a new textbook_

 * Hadrien Montanelli, University of Oxford:<br />
   _Fast solution of stiff PDEs in 1D, 2D and 3D_

 * Jared Aurentz, University of Oxford:<br />
   _Automatic construction of numerical adjoints and applications_

 * Olivier S&egrave;te, University of Oxford:<br />
   _Analytic continuation of Lorenz trajectories into the complex plane_

 * Behnam Hashemi, University of Oxford:<br />
   _Chebfun in three dimensions_

 * Mikael Slevinsky, University of Oxford:<br />
   _A fast free alternative to Chebfun and MATLAB: ApproxFun and Julia_
