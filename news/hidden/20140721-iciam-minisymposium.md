Chebfun friends &mdash;

We expect there will be a Chebfun-related minisymposium at the [ICIAM
meeting](http://www.iciam2015.cn/) in Beijing in August 2015; likely speakers
include myself, Stefan Guettel, Yuji Nakatsukasa, Vanni Noferini, Sheehan
Olver, Grady Wright, and Kuan Xu.  One possibility might be to mix this with
some "applications of Chebfun" talks by Chebfun users.  If you might be
interested in contributing such a talk, would you get in touch with me?

Many thanks,
