Chebfun Version 5.0.1 has been released. Mostly the new release consists of
minor bug fixes and improvements. For users, the most noticeable change is in
the command ``chebcoeffs``. This used to be identical to ``chebpoly``,
returning a row vector of coefficients from highest degree down to zero
degree. Now ``chebpoly`` has been deprecated and ``chebcoeffs`` returns a
column vector of coefficients from zero degree up to highest. ``fourcoeffs``
has also been changed to return a column vector.
