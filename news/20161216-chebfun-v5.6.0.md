---

The Chebfun team is pleased to announce the release of Chebfun
v5.6.0 for numerical computing with functions in 1D, 2D, and 3D.
Here are some noteworthy features.

* DISKFUN for functions on the unit disk.
See Chebfun Guide, chap. 16,
<http://www.chebfun.org/docs/guide/guide16.html>.

* GALLERYSPHERE collection of functions on the unit sphere
See Chebfun Guide, chap. 17,
<http://www.chebfun.org/docs/guide/guide17.html>.

* TRIGRATINTERP and TRIGREMEZ for rational interpolation/
least-squares and best approximation of periodic functions.

* AAA for rational approximation on real or complex domains,
based on greedy construction of rational barycentric fractions.
See <http://www.chebfun.org/examples/approx/AAAApprox.html>.

* ADJOINT for computing the adjoint of a chebop.  See
`help chebop/adjoint`.

* CHEBFUN2/EIG for eigenvalues of a chebfun2 on a square
domain, interpreted as the kernel of an integral operator.

* Improvements to SPIN/SPIN2/SPIN3 for stiff PDEs, and some
changes in syntax.  See Chebfun Guide, chap. 19 and
examples in <http://www.chebfun.org/examples/pde>.

* New capabilities for composing chebfun/chebfun2/chebfun3 objects.
See <http://www.chebfun.org/examples/opt/ConstrainedExtrema.html>.

* Updated list of about 50 Chebfun publications at
<http://www.chebfun.org/publications/>.

We hope you enjoy the new release.  If you have questions
