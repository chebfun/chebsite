function reference:

    - Do we care that some of the help texts mention TECHs? e.g.

        chebfun/conv
        chebfun/get
        resampling
        chebkind
        chebfunpref

----

find . -name "*.md" -type f -delete

/Applications/MATLAB_R2013a.app/toolbox/matlab/codetools/private/mxdom2simplehtml.xsl
/Applications/MATLAB_R2013a.app/toolbox/matlab/codetools/+internal/+matlab/+publish/chebexample_PublishFigures.m

is both a directory and a function

We can hope that no one ever finds out, but:

1. If you have an ordered list in an example AND no references section, the
   numbering on the ordered list will have brackets like the references
   should.

2. A figure with multiple subpots, one of which has a surface or patch
   element, but which one is not the last subplot plotted, will render
   incorrectly (i.e. it will use Painters instead of openGL).
