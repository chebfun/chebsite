 EXPM    Exponential semigroup of a linear CHEBOP.
    U = EXPM(L, T, U0) uses matrix exponentiation to propagate an initial
    condition U0 for time T through the differential equation u' = L*u, where L
    is a linear CHEBOP. Formally, the solution is given by u(t) = exp(t*L)*u0,
    where exp(t*L) is a semigroup generated by L. Here U0 may be a CHEBFUN or a
    CHEBMATRIX of approriate dimensions.
 
    If T is a vector, then U is a CHEBMATRIX and will have one column for each
    entry of T. If T is a scalar and U0 is a scalar CHEBFUN or CHEBMATRIX, then
    U is a CHEBFUN.
 
    L should have appropriate boundary conditions to make the problem
    well-posed. Those conditions have zero values; i.e., are represented by
    B*u(t) = 0 for a linear functional B.
 
    EXPM(..., PREFS) accepts a preference structure or object like that created
    by CHEBOPPREF.
 
    EXAMPLE: Heat equation
       d = [-1 1];  x = chebfun('x', d);
       A = chebop(@(u) diff(u, 2), [-1, 1], 0);
       u0 = exp(-20*(x+0.3).^2);  
       t = [0 0.001 0.01 0.1 0.5 1];
       u = expm(A, t, u0);
       colr = zeros(6, 3); colr(:,1) = 0.85.^(0:5)';
       clf, set(gcf, 'defaultaxescolororder', colr)
       plot(chebfun(u), 'linewidth', 2)
 
    E = EXPM(T*L) is supported for backwards compatability, and returns a CHEBOP
    E which can be applied to U0, so that U = E*U0, or U = E(U0). However, this
    syntax is deprecated and may be removed in future releases. EXPM(L, T, U0)
    as described above is the prefered syntax.
