<pre class="help-text">  VAL2COEFFS   Convert matrix of Chebyshev coefficients to values.
 
  V = COEFFS2VALS( C ) given a matrix of bivariate coefficient evaluate the 
  Chebyshev series on a grid size(C).
  
  [U, S, V] = COEFFS2VALS( U, S, V ) the same as above but keeps everything in low
  rank form.
