<pre class="help-text"> JACOBIAN   Jacobian determinant of a CHEBFUN2V.
    J = JACOBIAN(F) computes the determinant of the Jacobian matrix associated
    to the vector-valued CHEBFUN2V F. The CHEBFUN2V must have two components.
 
    Note we return the determinant of the Jacobian matrix and not the Jacobian
    matrix itself.
