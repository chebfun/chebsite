<pre class="help-text"> SURF Plot of the surface represented by a CHEBFUN2V.
 
  SURF(F) is the surface plot of F, where F is a CHEBFUN2V with three
  components.
 
  SURF(F,'-') also shows the seams of the parameterisation on the surface.
 
  SURF(F,...) allows for the same plotting options as Matlab's SURF
  command.
 
  See also CHEBFUN2/SURF.
