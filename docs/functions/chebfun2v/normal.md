<pre class="help-text"> NORMAL normal vector to a surface represented by a CHEBFUN2V.
    N = NORMAL(F) returns a CHEBFUN2V representing the normal vector to the
    surface F. The vector has the same magntiude as the surface's tangent vector
 
    N = NORMAL(F,'unit') returns the unit normal vector, represented as a
    CHEBFUN2V, to the surface F.
