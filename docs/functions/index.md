Many of the most common user-facing functions of Chebfun Version 5 are
documented in this function reference. Chebfun changes more quickly than
this web page gets updated, so if in doubt, use the MATLAB `help`
command to get the documentation for the specific version of Chebfun you
are working with.

This function reference is automatically generated and still new, and we
apologize that some of the links may be broken.
