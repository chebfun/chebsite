 SUBSREF   CHEBFUN subsref.
  ( )
    F(X) returns the values of the CHEBFUN F evaluated on the array X. If X
    falls on a breakpoint of F, the corresponding value from F.IMPULSES is
    returned. F(X, 'left') or F(X, 'right') will evaluate F at breakpoints
    using left- or right-hand limits, respectively. See CHEBFUN/FEVAL for
    further details. F(:) returns F.
 
    If F is an array-valued CHEBFUN then F(X, COL) returns the values of the
    columns specified by the vector COL at the points X. Similarly, F(:, COL)
    returns a new array-vlaued CHEBFUN containing only the columns specified in
    COL. In both cases, COL should be a row vector.
 
    F(G), where G is also a CHEBFUN, computes the composition of F and G. See
    CHEBFUN/COMPOSE for further details.
 
  .
    F.PROP returns the property PROP of F as defined by GET(F, 'PROP').
 
  {}
    F{S1, S2} restricts F to the domain [S1, S2] < [F.ENDS(1), F.ENDS(end)] and
    simplifies the result. See RESTRICT  and SIMPLIFY for further details. Note
    that F{[S1, S2]} is not supported due to the behaviour of the MATLAB
    subsref() command.
