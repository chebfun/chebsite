 QUANTUMSTATES    Compute and plot Schroedinger eigenstates.
    This program computes and plots eigenvalues lambda and eigenfunctions u
    for the equation Lu = lambda*u, where L is the Schroedinger operator
    defined by Lu(x) = -h^2*u"(u) + V(x)*u(x).  Here h is a small parameter
    and the potential function V is given as a Chebfun. The domain of the
    problem is the domain of V, with boundary conditions u=0 at both ends.
 
    Inputs:
 
        QUANTUMSTATES(V) plots 10 eigenstates for h=0.1
        QUANTUMSTATES(V, n) plots n eigenstates for h=0.1
        QUANTUMSTATES(V, h), h noninteger, plots 10 eigenstates for given h
        QUANTUMSTATES(V, n, h) plots n eigenstates for given h
        QUANTUMSTATES(..., 'noplot') produces no plot
 
    Outputs:
  
        D = QUANTUMSTATES(...) returns a vector D of eigenvalues
        [U, D] = QUANTUMSTATES(...) returns a quasimatrix U of eigenfunctions
        and a diagonal matrix of eigenvalues
 
    Examples:
 
        x = chebfun('x', [-3, 3]);
        V = x.^2;
