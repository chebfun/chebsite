<pre class="help-text"> AREA   Filled CHEBFUN area plot.
    AREA(X, F) or AREA(F) is the same as PLOT(X, F) or PLOT(F) except that the
    area between 0 and F is filled. When F is array-valued, AREA(F) plots the
    columns of Y as filled areas.
 
    AREA(F, LEVEL) specifies the base level for the area plot to be at the value
    y = LEVEL. The default value is LEVEL = 0.
 
    AREA(..., 'Prop1', VALUE1, 'Prop2', VALUE2,...) sets the specified
    properties of the underlying areaseries objects.
  
    AREA(AX, ...) plots into axes with handle AX. Use GCA to get the handle to
    the current axes or to create one if none exist.
  
    H = AREA(...) returns a vector of handles to areaseries objects.
    
  See also PLOT.
