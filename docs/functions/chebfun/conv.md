<pre class="help-text"> CONV   Convolution of CHEBFUN objects.
    H = CONV(F, G) produces the convolution of CHEBFUN objects F and G:
                      - 
                     /
            H(x) =   |    F(t) G(x-t) dt,  x in [a + c, b + d]
                     /
                    -
    where domain(F) is [a, b] and domain(G) is [c, d]. The integral is taken
    over all t for which the integrand is defined: max(a, x - d) <= t <= min(b,
    x - c).  The breakpoints of H are all pairwise sums of the breakpoints of F
    and G.
 
    If F and G are simple, in the sense that their FUNS are CHEBTECH objects, a
    fast algorithm due to Hale and Townsend is used [1]. Otherwise, the integral
    is computed by brute force. CONV(F, G, 'old') forces the brute force
    approach, even when the fast algorithm may be used.
 
    Note that CONV only supports piecewise-smooth functions on bounded domains.
 
    Example:
      f = chebfun(1/2); g = f;
      subplot(2, 2, 1), plot(f)
      for j = 2:4, g = conv(f, g); subplot(2, 2, j), plot(g), end
      figure, for j = 1:4, subplot(2,2,j), plot(g), g = diff(g); end
