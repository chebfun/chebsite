  ( )
    F(X) = VAL assigns the values VAL at locations specified by X to the 
    CHEBFUN F. SIZE(X, 1) should be equal to LENGTH(VAL) and SIZE(X, 2) should 
    be the number of columns in F. SUBSASGN introduces new breakpoints
    in F at points in X that were not originally in F.DOMAIN. See DEFINEPOINT
    for further details.
 
  .
    CHEBFUN properties are restricted, so F.PROP = VAL has no effect.
 
  {}
    F{A, B} = G redefines the CHEBFUN F in the interval [A, B] using G. See
    CHEBFUN/DEFINEINTERVAL for further details.
