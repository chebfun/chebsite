<pre class="help-text"> ANY   True if any value of a CHEBFUN is nonzero. ANY ignores entries that are
       NaN (Not a Number).
    ANY(X, DIM), where X is an array-valued CHEBFUN, works down the dimension
    DIM. If DIM is the CHEBFUN (continuous) dimension, then ANY returns a
    logical column vector (or row) in which the Jth element is TRUE if the Jth
    column (or row) has a nonzero value. Otherwise, ANY returns a CHEBFUN which
    takes the value 1 wherever any of the columns (or rows) of X are nonzero,
    and zero everywhere else.
 
    ANY(X) is shorthand for ANY(X, 1).
