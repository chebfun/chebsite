<pre class="help-text"> CHEBPADE   Chebyshev-Pade approximation.
    [P, Q, R_HANDLE] = CHEBPADE(F, M, N) computes polynomials P and Q of degree
    M and N, respectively, such that the rational function P/Q is the type (M,
    N) Chebyshev-Pade approximation of type Clenshaw-Lord to the CHEBFUN F. That
    is, the Chebyshev series of P/Q coincides with that for the CHEBFUN F up to
    the maximum possible order for the polynomial degrees permitted. R_HANDLE is
    a function handle for evaluating the rational function.
 
    [P, Q, R_HANDLE] = CHEBPADE(F, M, N, TYPE) allows one to additionally
    specify the type of Chebyshev-Pade approximation sought. If TYPE is set to
    'clenshawlord', the Clenshaw-Lord approximation as described above is used.
    Alternatively, setting TYPE to 'maehly' computes a Maehly-type
    approximation, which satisfies a linearized version of the Chebyshev-Pade
    conditions.
 
    [P, Q, R_HANDLE] = CHEBPADE(F, M, N, TYPE, K) uses only the K-th partial sum
    in the Chebyshev expansion of F when computing the approximation. CHEPADE(F,
    M, N, K) is shorthand for CHEBPADE(F, M, N, 'clenshawlord', K).
