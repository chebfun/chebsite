 SUM   Definite integral of a CHEBFUN.
    SUM(F) is the integral of a column CHEBFUN F over its domain of definition.
 
    SUM(F, A, B), where A and B are scalars, integrates a column CHEBFUN F over
    [A, B], which must be a subdomain of F.domain:
 
                          B
                          /
                SUM(F) =  | F(t) dt.
                          /
                         A
 
    SUM(F, A, B), where A and B are CHEBFUN objects, returns a CHEBFUN S which
    satisfies
 
                        B(s)
                        /
                S(s) =  | F(t) dt.
                        /
                      A(s)
 
    SUM(F, DIM), where DIM is one of 1, 2, sums F over the dimension DIM. If F
    is a column CHEBFUN and DIM = 1 or if F is a row CHEBFUN and DIM = 2 then
    this integrates in the continuous dimension of F, as described above.
    Otherwise, SUM(F, DIM) sums across the columns (rows) of the column (row)
    CHEBFUN F.
