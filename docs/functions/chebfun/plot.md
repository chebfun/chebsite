 PLOT   Basic linear plot for CHEBFUN objects.
    PLOT(F) plots the CHEBFUN object F.
 
    PLOT(F, S) allows various line types, plot symbols, and colors to be used
    when S is a character string made from one element from any or all the
    following 3 columns:
 
             b     blue          .     point              -     solid
             g     green         o     circle             :     dotted
             r     red           x     x-mark             -.    dashdot
             c     cyan          +     plus               --    dashed
             m     magenta       *     star             (none)  no line
             y     yellow        s     square
             k     black         d     diamond
             w     white         v     triangle (down)
                                 ^     triangle (up)
                                 <     triangle (left)
                                 >     triangle (right)
                                 p     pentagram
                                 h     hexagram
 
    The entries from the centre columns are plotted at the grid being used to
    represent F (typically Chebyshev).
 
    The X,Y pairs, or X,Y,S triples, can be followed by parameter/value pairs to
    specify additional properties of the lines. For example,
             f = chebfun(@sin);
             plot(f, 'LineWidth', 2, 'Color', [.6 0 0])
    will create a plot with a dark red line width of 2 points.
 
    PLOT(F1, S1, F2, S2, F3, S3, ...) or PLOT(F1, G1, S1, F2, G2, S2, ...)
    combines the plots defined by the (F,G,S) triples or (F,S) doubles, where
    the F's and G's are CHEBFUN object and the S's are strings.
 
    [HLINE, HPOINT, HJUMP] = PLOT(F) returns column vectors of handles to
    lineseries objects (one for each column in the case of array-valued CHEBFUN
    objects), corresponding to the line, point, and jump plots, respectively.
 
    PLOT(F, 'interval', [A, B]) restricts the plot to the interval [A, B], which
    can be useful when the domain of F is infinite, or for 'zooming in' on, say,
    oscillatory CHEBFUN objects. If plotting an array-valued CHEBFUN or more
    than one CHEBFUN in a call like PLOT(F, 'b', G, '--r', 'interval', [A, B])
    this property is applied globally.
 
    Besides the usual parameters that control the specifications of lines (see
    linespec), the parameter JumpLine and DeltaLine determines the linestyle 
    for the discontinuities and the delta functions of the CHEBFUN F, 
    respetively. For example, PLOT(F, 'JumpLine', '-r') will plot 
    discontinuities as solid red lines and PLOT(F, 'deltaline', '-r') will 
    plot the delta functions as solid red lines. By default the plotting style
    for JumpLine is ':', and '-' for delta functions and colours are chosen 
    to match the lines they correspond to. It is possible to modify other 
    properties of JumpLines syntax like 
    PLOT(F, 'JumpLine', {'color', 'r', 'LineWidth', 5}). 
    JumpLines and deltaLines can be suppresse with the argument 'none'.
 
    Note that the PLOT(F, 'numpts', N) option for V4 is deprecated, and this
    call now has no effect.
