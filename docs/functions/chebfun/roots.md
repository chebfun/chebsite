 ROOTS   Roots of a CHEBFUN.
    ROOTS(F) returns the roots of F in its domain of definition. By default,
    roots are returned at jumps in F which pass through zero, and if F is
    identically zero on a part of its domain, then a single root is returned at
    the midpoint. Each of these behaviours can be modified using the optional
    inputs described below:
 
    ROOTS(F, 'nojump') prevents ROOTS() from returning points where F changes
    sign due to a jump discontinuity, such as roots(chebfun(@sign, 'splitting',
    'on')).
 
    ROOTS(F, 'nozerofun') prevents ROOTS() from returning a zero at the midpoint
    of the domain of F when F if identically zero, such as ROOTS(chebfun(0)).
  
    ROOTS(F, 'norecursion') deactivates the recursion procedure used to compute
    roots (see the Guide 3: Rootfinding and minima and maxima for more
    information on this recursion procedure).
 
    ROOTS(F, 'all') returns the roots of all the FUN objects representing the
    smooth pieces of F. Note that by default this disables recursion, and so is
    equivalent to ROOTS(F, 'all', 'norecursion').
 
    ROOTS(F, 'complex') returns the real and complex roots of the FUN objects
    representing the smooth pieces of F that are determined to be non-spurious.
    (See CHEBELLIPSEPLOT). This capability may remove some spurious roots that
    can appear if using ROOTS(F, 'all'). ROOTS(F, 'complex') is equivalent to
    ROOTS(F, 'complex', 'recursion').
 
    ROOTS(F, 'all', 'recursion') and ROOTS(F, 'complex','norecursion') can be
    used to activate and deactivate the recursion procedure respectively, to
    compute the roots as explained in the 'all' and 'complex' modes.
