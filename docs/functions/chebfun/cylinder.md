<pre class="help-text"> CYLINDER Generate cylinder. Surface revolution of a chebfun to form a chebfun2.
 
    [X, Y, Z] = CYLINDER(R) forms the unit cylinder based revolving the 
    function R about the z-axis. X, Y, and Z are chebfun2 objects such that
    surf(X,Y,Z) displays the cylinder. 
 
    F = CYLINDER(R) constructs the chebfun2v that represents the surface of
    revolution. SURF(F) displays the cylinder.
 
    Omitting output arguments causes the cylinder to be displayed with a SURF
    plot.
