<pre class="help-text"> MERGE   Remove unnecessary breakpoints in from a CHEBFUN.
    F = MERGE(F, PREF) removes unnecessary breakpoints from a CHEBFUN F. In
    particular the kth breakpoint is removed if the resulting FUN on the
    interval [x_{k-1}, x_{k+1}] can be represented with a fewer than
    PREF.MAXLENGTH points when PREF.ENABLEBREAKPOINTDETECTION = 0 and
    PREF.BREAKPOINTPREFS.SPLITMAXLENGTH points when
    PREF.ENABLEBREAKPOINTDETECTION = 1. If a PREF is not passed, then the
    default CHEBFUN.PREF() is used.
 
    [F, MERGEDPTS] = MERGE(F) returns the index of the merged endpoints in the
    vector MERGEDPTS.
 
    MERGE(F, INDEX) attempts to eliminate the endpoints specified in INDEX.
    MERGE(F, 'all') is equivalent to MERGE(F, [2:length(F.domain)-1]). (Note
    that it doesn't make sense to consider merging the first and final
    breakpoints.)
 
    In all cases, elimination is attempted from left to right, and non-trivial
    pointValues will prevent merging at the corresponding breakpoints.
 
    Example:
        f = chebfun(@(x) abs(x), 'splitting','on');
        [g, mergedPts] = merge(f.^2);
