<pre class="help-text"> FILL  Filled 2-D CHEBFUN plots.
    FILL(F, G, C) fills the 2-D region defined by CHEBFUN objects F and G with
    the color specified by C. If necessary, the region is closed by connecting
    the first and last point of the curve defined by F and G.
 
    If C is a single character string chosen from the list 'r', 'g', 'b', 'c',
    'm', 'y', 'w', 'k', or an RGB row vector triple, [r g b], the polygon is
    filled with the constant specified color.
 
    If F and G are array-valued CHEBFUN objects of the same size, one region per
    column is drawn. FILL(F1, G1, C1, F2, G2, C2, ...) is another way of
    specifying multiple filled areas. Note that FILL does not support
    quasimatrix input.
 
    FILL sets the PATCH object FaceColor property to 'flat', 'interp', or a
    colorspec depending upon the value of the C matrix.
 
    H = FILL(...) returns a column vector of handles to PATCH objects, one
    handle per patch. The F, G, C triples can be followed by parameter/value
    pairs to specify additional properties of the patches.
