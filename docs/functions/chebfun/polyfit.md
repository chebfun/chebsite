 POLYFIT   Fit polynomial to a CHEBFUN.
    F = POLYFIT(Y, N) returns a CHEBFUN F corresponding to the polynomial of
    degree N that fits the CHEBFUN Y in the least-squares sense.
 
    If Y is a global polynomial of degree n then this code has an O(n (log n)^2)
    complexity. If Y is piecewise polynomial then it has an O(n^2) complexity.
 
    F = POLYFIT(X, Y, N, D), where D is a DOMAIN object, returns a CHEBFUN F on
    the domain D which corresponds to the polynomial of degree N that fits the
    data (X, Y) in the least-squares sense. X should be a real-valued column
    vector and Y should be a matrix with size(Y,1) = size(X,1).
 
    Note CHEBFUN/POLYFIT does not not support more than one output argument in
    the way that MATLAB/POLYFIT does.
