<pre class="help-text"> POLY	 Polynomial coefficients of a CHEBFUN.
    POLY(F) returns the polynomial coefficients of the first FUN of F.
 
    POLY(F, N) returns the polynomial coefficients of the Nth FUN of F. 
 
    For numerical work, the Chebyshev polynomial coefficients returned by
    CHEBPOLY() are more useful.
 
  See also CHEBPOLY.
