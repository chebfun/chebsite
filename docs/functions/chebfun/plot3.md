 PLOT3   Plot for CHEBFUN objects in 3-D space.
    PLOT3() is a three-dimensional analogue of PLOT().
 
    PLOT3(X, Y, Z), where X, Y, and Z are three CHEBFUN objects, plots a line in
    3-space. X, Y, and Z may be array-valued, but must have the same number of
    columns.
 
    Various line types, plot symbols, and colors may be obtained with PLOT3(X,
    Y, Z, S) where S is a string of length 1, 2 or 3 containing characters
    listed under the PLOT command.
 
    [HLINE, HPOINT, HJUMP] = PLOT(X, Y, Z) returns column vectors of handles to
    lineseries objects (one for each column in the case of array-valued CHEBFUN
    objects), corresponding to the line, point, and jump plots, respectively.
 
  Example: A helix:
    t = chebfun('t', [0, 10*pi]);
    plot3(sin(t), cos(t), t);
