<pre class="help-text"> ARCLENGTH	Compute the length of the arc defined by a CHEBFUN.
    ARCLENGTH(F) returns the arc length of the curve defined by CHEBFUN F in the
    x-y plane over the interval where it is defined. If F is a CHEBFUN of
    complex values, the output is the arc length of the curve in the complex
    plane.
 
    ARCLENGTH(F, A, B) returns the arc length of F over the interval [A, B],
    where [A, B] is a subinterval of the domain in which F is defined. In the
    case of complex-valued F, ARCLENGTH(F, A, B) computes the length of the arc
    whose ends correspond to A and B.
 
    If F is a quasimatrix, the arc length of each CHEBFUN in F will be computed
    and a vector is returned.
 
  Examples:
    f = chebfun(@(x) sin(x), [0 1]);
    L = arcLength(f);
