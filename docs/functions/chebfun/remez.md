 REMEZ   Best polynomial or rational approximation.
    P = REMEZ(F, M) computes the best polynomial approximation of degree M to
    the CHEBFUN F in the infinity norm using the Remez algorithm.
 
    [P, Q] = REMEZ(F, M, N) computes the best rational approximation P/Q of type
    (M, N) to the CHEBFUN F using the Remez algorithm.
 
    [P, Q, R_HANDLE] = REMEZ(F, M, N) does the same but additionally returns a
    function handle R_HANDLE for evaluating the rational function P/Q.
 
    [...] = REMEZ(..., 'tol', TOL) uses the value TOL as the termination
    tolerance on the increase of the levelled error.
 
    [...] = REMEZ(..., 'display', 'iter') displays output at each iteration.
 
    [...] = REMEZ(..., 'maxiter', MAXITER) sets the maximum number of allowable
    iterations to MAXITER.
 
    [...] = REMEZ(..., 'plotfcns', 'error') plots the error after each iteration
    while the algorithm executes.
 
    [P, ERR] = REMEZ(...) and [P, Q, R_HANDLE, ERR] = REMEZ(...) also returns
    the maximum error ERR.
 
    [P, ERR, STATUS] = REMEZ(...) and [P, Q, R_HANDLE, ERR, STATUS] = REMEZ(...)
    also return a structure array STATUS with the following fields:
       STATUS.DELTA  - Obtained tolerance.
       STATUS.ITER   - Number of iterations performed.
       STATUS.DIFFX  - Maximum correction in last trial reference.
       STATUS.XK     - Last trial reference on which the error equioscillates.
 
    This code is quite reliable for polynomial approximations but rather
    fragile for rational approximations.  Better results can often be obtained
    with CF(), especially if f is smooth.
