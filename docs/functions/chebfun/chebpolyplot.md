<pre class="help-text"> CHEBPOLYPLOT   Display Chebyshev coefficients graphically.
    CHEBPOLYPLOT(F) plots the Chebyshev coefficients of a CHEBFUN F on a
    semilogy scale. A horizontal line at the epslevel of F is also plotted. If
    F is an array-valued CHEBFUN or has breakpoints, then a curve is plotted
    for each FUN of each component (column) of F.
 
    CHEBPOLYPLOT(F, S) allows further plotting options, such as linestyle,
    linecolor, etc, in the standard MATLAB manner. If S contains a string
    'LOGLOG', the coefficients will be displayed on a log-log scale. If S
    contains a string 'NOEPSLEVEL' the epslevel is not plotted.
 
    H = CHEBPOLYPLOT(F) returns a column vector of handles to lineseries
    objects. The final entry is that of the epslevel plot.
