<pre class="help-text"> SPLINE   CHEBFUN cubic spline data interpolation.
    F = CHEBFUN.SPLINE(X, Y) returns a CHEBFUN F with domain [X(1), X(end)]
    representing the cubic spline interpolant to the data values Y at the data
    sites X. X must be a vector. If Y is a vector, then Y(j) is taken as the
    value to be matched at X(j), hence Y must be of the same length as X  -- see
    below for an exception to this. If Y is a matrix, then Y(:,j) is taken as
    the value to be matched at X(j).
 
    F = CHEBFUN.SPLINE(X, Y, D) is similar, but F is defined on the domain D.
 
    Ordinarily, the not-a-knot end conditions are used. However, if Y contains
    two more values than X has entries, then the first and last value in Y are
    used as the end slopes for the cubic spline.
 
    Example:
    This generates a sine-like spline curve and samples it over a finer mesh:
        x = 0:10;  y = sin(x);
        f = chebfun.spline(x, y);
        plot(x, y, 'o', f)
