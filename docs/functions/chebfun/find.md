<pre class="help-text"> FIND   Find locations of nonzeros in a CHEBFUN.
    FIND(F) returns a vector of all values at which the CHEBFUN F is nonzero.
 
    [R, C] = FIND(F) returns two column vectors of the same length such that
    [F(R(n),C(n)) for all n = 1:length(R)] is the list of all nonzero values of
    the CHEBFUN F. One of the outputs holds dependent variable values, and
    the other holds CHEBFUN row or column indices.
 
    If the set of nonzero locations is not finite, an error is thrown.
 
  Example:
    f = chebfun(@sin, [0. 2*pi]);
    format long, find(f == 1/2) / pi
