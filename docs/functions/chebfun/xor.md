<pre class="help-text"> XOR   Logical CHEBFUN EXCLUSIVE OR.
      XOR(S,T) is the logical symmetric difference of CHEBFUNs S and T.
      The result is logical 1 (TRUE) where either S or T, but not both, is
      nonzero.  The result is logical 0 (FALSE) where S and T are both zero
      or nonzero.  S and T must have the same dimensions (or one can be a
      scalar).
