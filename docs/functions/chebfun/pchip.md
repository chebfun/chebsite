<pre class="help-text"> PCHIP   CHEBFUN Cubic Hermite interpolating polynomial.
    F = CHEBFUN.PCHIP(X, Y) returns a CHEBFUN F representing a certain
    shape-preserving piecewise cubic Hermite interpolant to the values Y at the
    sites X. X must be a vector. If Y is a vector, then Y(j) is taken as the
    value to be matched at X(j), hence Y must be of the same length as X. If Y
    is a matrix, then Y(:,j) is taken as the value to be matched at X(j).
 
    F = CHEBFUN.PCHIP(X, Y, D) is similar, but F is defined on the domain D.
 
   Example:
     x = -3:3;
     y = [-1 -1 -1 0 1 1 1];
     plot(chebfun.pchip(x, y)); hold on, 
     plot(chebfun.spline(x, y), '-r');
     plot(x, y, 'or'), hold off
