<pre class="help-text"> COMPOSE  Composition of CHEBFUN objects.
    COMPOSE(F, OP) returns a CHEBFUN representing OP(F), where F is also a
    CHEBFUN object and OP is a function handle.
 
    COMPOSE(F, OP, G) returns OP(F, G), where F and G are CHEBFUN objects and OP
    is a function handle. The domains and dimensions of F and G should be
    compatible.
 
    COMPOSE(F, G) returns a CHEBFUN representing G(F), where both F and G are
    also CHEBFUN objects. If the range of F is not contained in the domain of G,
    or if F and G do not have the same dimensions, then an error is thrown.
 
    COMPOSE(F, OP, PREF), COMPOSE(F, OP, G, PREF), and COMPOSE(F, G, PREF) use
    the options passed by the CHEBFUNPREF object PREF.
 
    Note: If the locations of required breakpoints in the output are known in
    advance, they should be applied to F and/or G using RESTRICT() before the
    call to COMPOSE().
