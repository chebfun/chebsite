<pre class="help-text"> BVP4C   Solve boundary value problems for ODEs by collocation with CHEBFUN.
    Y = BVP4C(ODEFUN, BCFUN, Y0) applies the standard BVP4C method to solve a
    boundary-value problem. ODEFUN and BCFUN are as in BVP4C. The Y0 argument is
    a CHEBFUN that represents the initial guess to the solution Y. Its domain
    defines the domain of the problem, and the length of the CHEBFUN Y0 is used
    to set the number of points in an initial equispaced mesh. Note that it is
    not necessary to call BVPINIT.
 
    [Y, P] = BVP4C(ODEFUN, BCFUN, Y0, PARAM, OPTS) allows you to specify an
    initial guess for any additional parameters to be found for the solution,
    and an options vector to guide the solution. See the built in BVP4C and
    BVPSET for details. You may specify either extra argument, or both. An
    additional output is used to return the parameter values found.
 
    It is possible to take a crude continuation approach by solving for a simple
    variation of the problem, then using the resulting CHEBFUN as the initial
    guess for a more difficult version.
 
  Example (using built-in BVP demo functions):
    y0 = chebfun([0, 0], [0, 4]);
    y = bvp4c(@twoode, @twobc, y0);
    plot(y)
