 FRED   Fredholm integral operator.
 
    F = FRED(K, V) computes the Fredholm integral with kernel K:
 
       (F*v)(x) = int( K(x,y)*v(y), y=a..b ),
 
    where [a b] = domain(V). The kernel function K(x,y) should be smooth for
    best results.
 
    K must be defined as a function of two inputs X and Y. These may be scalar
    and vector, or they may be matrices defined by NDGRID to represent a tensor
    product of points in DxD.
 
    FRED(K, V, 'onevar') will avoid calling K with tensor product matrices X and
    Y. Instead, the kernel function K should interpret a call K(x) as a vector x
    defining the tensor product grid. This format allows a separable or sparse
    representation for increased efficiency in some cases.
