 END   Rightmost point of a CHEBFUN domain (or last row/col of quasimatrix).
    END(F, K, N) This function is called for indexing expressions involving a
    CHEBFUN F when END is part of the K-th index out of N indices.
 
    If F is a column CHEBFUN and K is 1, this function returns the last point
    in F's domain. If K is 2, it returns the index of F's last column.
 
    If F is a row CHEBFUN and K is 1, this function returns the index of F's
    last row. If K is 2, it returns the last point in F's domain.
