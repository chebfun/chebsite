<pre class="help-text"> DISPLAY   Display a chebfun object.
    DISPLAY(F) outputs important information about the chebfun F to the command
    window, including its domain of definition, its length (number of sample
    values used to represent it), and a summary of its values at its endpoints.
    DISPLAY(F) is called automatically when the semicolon is not used at the end
    of a statement that results in a CHEBFUN.
