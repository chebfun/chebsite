 CF   Caratheodory-Fejer approximation
    [P, Q, R_HANDLE] = CF(F, M, N) computes a type (M, N) rational CF
    approximant to CHEBFUN F defined on [a, b], which must consist of just a
    single FUN. P and Q are CHEBFUNs representing the numerator and denominator
    polynomials. R_HANDLE is an anonymous function that evaluates P/Q.
 
    [P, Q, R_HANDLE, S] = CF(F, M, N) also returns S, the associated CF singular
    value, an approximation to the minimax error.
 
    [P, Q, R_HANDLE, S] = CF(F, M, N, K) does the same but uses only the K-th
    partial sum in Chebyshev expansion of F.
 
    For polynomial CF approximation, use N = 0 or N = [] or only provide two
    input arguments. If P and S are required, four output arguments must be
    specified.
 
    If F is a quasimatrix then so are the outputs P and Q, R_HANDLE is a cell
    array of function handles and s is a vector.
 
    Rational CF approximation can be very ill-conditioned for non-smooth
    functions. If the program detects this, a warning message is given and the
    results may be wrong.
 
    CF = Caratheodory-Fejer approximation is a near-best approximation that is
    often indistinguishable from the true best approximation (which for
    polynomials can be computed using REMEZ(F, M)), but often much faster to
    compute.
 
    Examples:
 
    Compute a quadratic polynomial CF approximant to exp(x) on [-1, 1]:
 
      [p, q, r] = cf(chebfun(@exp), 2);
 
    Compute a type-(4, 4) rational CF approximant to the same function:
 
      [p, q, r] = cf(chebfun(@exp), 4, 4);
