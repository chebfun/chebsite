 CUMSUM   Indefinite integral of a CHEBFUN.
    G = CUMSUM(F) is the indefinite integral of the column CHEBFUN F. G will
    typically be normalised so that G(F.domain(1)) = 0. The exception to this is
    when computing indefinite integrals of functions whose indefinite integrals
    have singularities. In this case, the arbitrary constant in the indefinite
    integral is chosen to make the representation of G as simple as possible.
 
    CUMSUM(F, N) returns the Nth integral of F. If N is not an integer then
    CUMSUM(F, N) returns the fractional integral of order N as defined by the
    Riemann-Liouville integral.
 
    CUMSUM(F, N, 2) will take the Nth cumulative sum over the columns F an
    array-valued CHEBFUN or quasimatrix.
