 ODE113   Solve stiff differential equations and DAEs. Output a CHEBFUN.
    Y = CHEBFUN.ODE113(ODEFUN, D, ...) applies the standard ODE113 method to
    solve an initial-value problem on the domain D. The result is then converted
    to a piecewise-defined CHEBFUN with one column per solution component.
 
    CHEBFUN.ODE113 has the same calling sequence as Matlab's standard ODE113. 
 
    One can also write [T, Y] = ODE113(...), in which case T is a linear CHEBFUN
    on the domain D.
 
  Example:
    y = chebfun.ode113(@vdp1, [0, 20], [2 ; 0]);
