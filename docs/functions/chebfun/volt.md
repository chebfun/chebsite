 VOLT   Volterra integral operator.
    V = VOLT(K,D) constructs a chebop representing the Volterra integral
    operator with kernel K for functions in domain D=[a,b]:
 
       (V*v)(x) = int( K(x,y) v(y), y = a..x )
 
    The kernel function K(x,y) should be smooth for best results.
 
    K must be defined as a function of two inputs X and Y. These may be scalar
    and vector, or they may be matrices defined by NDGRID to represent a tensor
    product of points in DxD.
 
    VOLT(K, D, 'onevar') will avoid calling K with tensor product matrices X and
    Y. Instead, the kernel function K should interpret a call K(x) as a vector x
    defining the tensor product grid. This format allows a separable or sparse
    representation for increased efficiency in some cases.
 
  Example:
 
    To solve u(x) + x*int(exp(x-y)*u(y), y=0..x) = f(x) on [0, 2]:
    V = chebop(@(x, u) u + x.*volt(@(x, y) exp(x-y), u), [0, 2]);
    u = V \ sin(exp(3*x));
