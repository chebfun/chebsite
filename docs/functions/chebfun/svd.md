 SVD   Singular value decomposition of a CHEBFUN.
    [U, S, V] = SVD(A) or SVD(A, 0), where A is an array-valued column CHEBFUN
    with N columns, produces an N x N diagonal matrix S with nonnegative
    diagonal elements in nonincreasing order, a column CHEBFUN U with N
    orthonormal columns, and an N x N unitary matrix V such that A = U*S*V'.
 
    If A is a row CHEBFUN with N rows, then U is a unitary matrix and V' is an
    array-valued row CHEBFUN.
 
    S = SVD(A) returns a vector containing the singular values of A.
 
    The computation is carried out by orthogonalization operations following
    Battles's 2005 thesis [1].
