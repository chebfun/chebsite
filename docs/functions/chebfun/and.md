 &   CHEBFUN Logical AND
    F & G performs a logical AND of two CHEBFUN objects F and G and returns a
    CHEBFUN with values set to either logical 1 (TRUE) or logical 0 (FALSE).  A
    value of the output CHEBFUN is set to 0 if both input CHEBFUN objects have
    a non-zero value at that point, otherwise it is set to 0.
