 SUBSASGN   Subscripted assignment for CHEBPREF.
    P.PROP = VAL, where P is a CHEBPREF object, assigns the value
    VAL to the CHEBPREF property PROP stored in P.  If PROP is not a
    CHEBPREF property, an error will be thrown.
 
    CHEBPREF does not support any other subscripted assignment types,
    including '()' and '{}'.

Help for cheboppref/subsasgn is inherited from superclass CHEBPREF
