%% 1. Introduction
% Probability and statistics textbooks contain many exercise problems concerning
% various probability distributions.  In this Example we use Chebfun to solve
% two problems involving the uniform distribution from the textbook [1].
% The domain
% is a finite interval. Other similar Examples look at problems from the same
% book involving the normal, beta, exponential, gamma, Rayleigh, and Maxwell
% distributions.

%%
% Like most textbooks, [1] emphasizes problems that can be solved on paper and
% don't need numerical tools such as Chebfun. As soon as one varies the problem
% a little, however, numerical solutions often become necessary. Thus first we
% solve the problems as written, and then we show an application.

%% 2. Problem 1(c), page 124

%%
% _If $X$ is uniformly distributed over $(1,2)$, find $z$ such that
% $P[X>z+\mu_x]=1/4$._

%%
% We first define the probability density function (PDF) of $X$ as follows:
f = chebfun(@(x) 1/(2-1)+0*x, [1 2]);

%%
% The cumulative density function (CDF) of $X$ is the indefinite integral of
% $f$:
fint = cumsum(f);

%%
% We can compute the mean of $X$, denoted $\mu_x$, like this:
format long
mu_x = sum(chebfun(@(x) x.*f(x), [1 2]))

%%
% This is obviously correct.

%%
% Let $a = z+\mu_x$. Since $P[X>a] = 1/4$, we can find $a$ like this:
a = roots(1-fint-1/4)

%%
% Then we know the value of $z$:
z = a-mu_x

%%
% We now plot the PDF of this uniform distribution and the probability 
% $P[X>z+\mu_x] = 1/4$:
hold off, h = area(f{a, 2});
set(h,'FaceColor',[0.3 0.2 0.5]), xlim([1 2]), ylim([0, 2])
LW = 'linewidth';
hold on, plot(f,'k',LW,2), grid on

%% 3. Problem 1(m), page 124

%%
% _Suppose $X$ is a continuous random variable with uniform distribution having
% mean $1$ and variance $4/3$. What is $P[X<0]$?_

%%
% The probability density function (PDF) of the uniform distribution can be
% defined like this: $f = 1/(b-a)$ for $x \in (a,b)$.

%%
% Then the mean is $(a+b)/2$ and the variance is $(b-a)^2/12$.
% We want to solve for $a$ and $b$
% given the stated conditions on the mean and variance.

%%
% One approach would be to use Chebfun2. We can do that like this:
mean = 1;
var  = 4/3;

%%
% Let us assume that the roots are within a square of side length 10 centered at
% the origin
f = chebfun2( @(a,b) (a+b)/2 - mean, [-5,5,-5,5] );
g = chebfun2( @(a,b) (b-a).^2/12 - var,  [-5,5,-5,5] );

%%
% The common roots of $f$ and $g$ are the points
% where the mean and the variance attain the desired values.
r = roots( f, g ) 

%%
% We then get two pairs of values for $a$ and $b$.
% Since $a < b$, we can easily make
% the right choice of the $(a,b)$ pair and discard the other one.
% As we can see $a = -1$ and $b = 3$ are the correct choices.
a = min(r(2,:))
b = max(r(2,:))

%%
% Now we have the PDF of $X$ as follows:
f = chebfun(@(x)0*x + 1/(b-a),[a, b]);

%%
% The cumulative density function (CDF) is the
% indefinite integral of $f$:
fint = cumsum(f);

%% 
% $P[X<0]$ is this integral evaluated at $0$:
p = fint(0)

%%
% Let us plot $f$ on the interval $[a, b]$ and the region $x<0$.
hold off, h = area(f{a, 0});
set(h,'FaceColor',[0.75 0.3 0.2]), xlim([a, b]), ylim([0, 0.5])
LW = 'linewidth';
hold on, plot(f,'k',LW,1.6), grid on

%% 
% Alternatively, let us find $a$ and $b$ with Chebfun. One approach is to
% eliminate $b$ by hand and then use Chebfun's `roots`
% command to find $a$.

%%
% We express $b$ in terms of $a$ according to $mean = (a+b)/2 = 1$:
b = @(a) 2-a    

%%
% By $variance = (b-a)^2/12 = 4/3$,
% we can try $a$ in the interval $[-5,5]$ to see if
% we get a root for the function $g$ defined as:
g = chebfun(@(a) (b(a)-a).^2/12 -4/3, [-5,5]);
aa = roots(g)

%%
% As before, we can see $a = -1$ and $b = 3$ are the correct choices.
a = aa(1)
b = aa(2)

%%
% Let us plot $f$ on the interval $[-5,5]$, the two roots $a$ and $b$:
hold off, plot(g, LW, 2),
hold on, plot([-5,5],[0,0], '-k'), axis auto
plot(aa, g(a), 'r.', 'markersize', 20)
grid on

%%
% Another Chebfun approach would be to solve for both $a$ and
% $b$ using Chebfun2.

%%
% Let us define the mean of the distribution like this:
meanab = chebfun2(@(a, b) (a+b)/2, [-5, 5, -5, 5]);

%%
% Similarly, we can define the variance like this:
varab = chebfun2(@(a, b) (b-a).^2/12, [-5, 5, -5, 5]);

%%
% We can solve for $a$ and $b$ simultaneously as follows:
ab = roots(meanab-1, varab-4/3)

%%
% As there are two pairs of $a$ and $b$ listed in `ab, we need to identify the
% correct pair:
a = ab(1, 2)
b = ab(1, 1)

%% 4. Application adapted from Example 12, page 107 
% In a lottery draw, we let a participant spin a wheel and allow it to come to
% rest. The wheel is partitioned into ordered sectors:
% red ($5^\circ$), cyan ($15^\circ$), yellow ($35^\circ$),
% green ($50^\circ$), white ($65^\circ$), blue
% ($80^\circ$), black ($110^\circ$). Each color represents a prize. When the
% wheel comes to rest, a fixed arrow on the circumference points to a color. The
% participant then receives the prize that the corresponding color stands for.
% We can see that the point on the circumference of the wheel that is located
% opposite the fixed arrow could be considered as the value of a random variable
% $X$ that is uniformly distributed over the circumference of the wheel.

%%
% _(Q1) What is the probability of a participant receiving a prize represented
% by red or cyan?_

%%
% The PDF of $X$ can be defined like this:
f = chebfun(@(x) 1/(360-0)+0*x, [0 360]);

%%
% Let us plot the composition of the wheel:
FC = 'Facecolor';
hold off, h1 = area(f{0, 5}); set(h1,FC,[1 0 0]), axis auto
hold on, h2 = area(f{5, 20}); set(h2,FC,[0 1 1]),
h3 = area(f{20, 55}); set(h3,FC,[1 1 0]),
h4 = area(f{55, 105}); set(h4,FC,[0 1 0]),
h5 = area(f{105, 170}); set(h5,FC,[1 1 1]),
h6 = area(f{170, 250}); set(h6,FC,[0 0 1]),
h7 = area(f{250, 360}); set(h7,FC,[0 0 0]),
plot(f,'k',LW,2), grid on

%%
% The CDF of $X$ is thus:
fint = cumsum(f);

%%
% We can compute the probability of $0<X<(5+15)$ like this:
p1 = fint(5+15)

%%
% Let us compare `p1` to the exact value obtained by simple algebra:
p1_exact = (5+15)/360

%%
% Now we plot the probability:
hold off, plot(f,'k',LW,2), grid on
hold on, h = area(f{0, 20}); set(h,FC,[0.7 0 0.6]), 
xlim([0 360])

%%
% _(Q2) We now know that the arrow will not point to the blue region when the
% wheel comes to rest. Under this condition, what is the probability that it
% will point to neither black nor yellow?_

%%
% Because $X$ is uniformly distributed,
% the probability of the arrow not pointing
% to the blue region is:
pnb = 1-fint(80)

%%
% Similarly, the probability of the arrow not pointing to either the yellow or
% black region is:
pnyb = 1-fint(35)-fint(110)

%%
% So the probability of the arrow not pointing to any of yellow, black, or blue
% is:
pn = pnyb-fint(80)

%%
% By Bayes' Theorem, the conditional probability can be computed as follows:
p2 = pn/pnb

%%
% As before, we can compare `p2` to the exact
% value of the conditional probability
% obtained by simple algebra:
p2_exact = (1-(35+110+80)/360)/(1-80/360)

%%
% Now let us plot the conditional probability:
g= f/(280/360);
g = g.*chebfun({g,0,g}, [0, 170, 250, 360]);
hold off, h1 = area(g{0, 20}); set(h1,FC,[0.3 0.5 0.2]), 
hold on, h2 = area(g{55, 170}); set(h2,FC,[0.3 0.5 0.2]),
plot(g,'b',LW,2), xlim([0 360]), grid on
