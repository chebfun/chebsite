%%
% Crouzeix's conjecture is a fascinating open problem in matrix theory, which
% bounds the size of a function of a matrix, $p(A)$.  See [1].

%%
% Let $p$ be an analytic function, and in fact, it is enough to suppose $p$ is
% a polynomial.  Let $A$ be a square matrix, and let $\|\cdot\|$ be the 2-norm
% on matrices.  Crouzeix's conjecture is the inequality
% $$ \|p(A)\| \le 2\|p\|\_{W(A)} $$
% where $ \|p(A)\|\_{W(A)} $ denotes the maximum of $|p(z)|$ where $z$ ranges
% over the _field of values_ (or _numerical range_) of $A$.  $W(A)$ is defined
% as the set of Rayleigh quotients associated with $A$, and there is a Chebfun
% command `fov` to compute it.  This is a nonempty, bounded, convex set in the
% complex plane that contains the eigenvalues of $A$.  For more about $W(A)$,
% see the Chebfun Example [linalg/FieldOfValues](FieldOfValues.html).

%%
% Intriguingly, the inequality of Crouzeix's conjecture has been established
% with a weaker constant [2]:
% $$ \|p(A)\| \le 11.08 \|p\|_{W(A)}. $$
% Thus the challenge is to improve $11.08$ to $2$.  This is the best possible
% constant, as we shall see in a moment.

%%
% It is known that Crouzeix's inequality holds in all kinds of special cases,
% including if $A$ has dimension $2$, if $A^2=0$, if $A^3=0$ and $d=3$
% (Crouzeix 2012), if $W(A)$ is a disk (Badea 2004 based on work of von
% Neumann 1951 and Okubo and Ando 1975), if $p(z)=z^n$ (Berger 1965) and 1967,
% Pearcy 1966). or if $A$ is normal (in which case the constant $2$ can be
% improved to $1$ and the inequality is an equality). The case of matrices of
% dimension $3$ is open but has been explored so thoroughly numerically that
% if Crouzeix's conjecture is false, it is highly likely that the first
% counterexample is of dimension $4$ or higher.

%%
% Given a matrix $A$ and a polynomial $p$, let $c(A,p)$ be the "Crouzeix
% ratio" $\|p(A)\|/\|p\|_{W(A)}$.  We can compute this in a single line of
% Chebfun!
c = @(A,a) norm(polyvalm(a, A)) / norm(polyvalc(a, fov(A)), inf);

%%
% Here $a$ is a vector of coefficients of $p$, ordered from highest to lowest
% degree in Matlab's usual fashion, and polyvalc is a function that evaluates
% a polynomial of a chebfun. (We should probably replace this with an overload
% of polyval for chebfuns.)

function pf = polyvalc(a,f)  % evaluate polynomial of chebfun f
    pf = a(end)*f.^0;
    for k = 1:length(a)-1
        pf = pf + a(end-k)*f.^k;
    end
end

%%
% For example, here is an example that shows that the constant $2$ is best
% possible, namely $p(A) = A$ where $A$ is a Jordan block of dimension 2:
A = [0 1 ; 0 0];
a = [1 0];
c(A,a)

%%
% Here is a random matrix of dimension 20 with a random polynomial of degree 4:
rng('default'), A = randn(20)/sqrt(20);
a = randn(5, 1);
c(A,a)

%%
% Here is the same polynomial with the matrix B defined as a diagonal matrix,
% hence normal, with the same eigenvalues as A. In this case the Crouzeix ratio
% must be $1$.
B = diag(eig(A));
c(B,a)

%%
% We have done experiments with an optimization code to try to find
% counterexamples to Crouzeix conjecture for matrices of various dimensions,
% and so far, we have found no counterexamples.
