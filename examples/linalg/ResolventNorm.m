% If $A$ is a square matrix, the resolvent of $A$ for a particular complex
% number $z$ is the matrix $(zI-A)^{-1}$.  The $2$-norm of the resolvent
% is a quantity of interest in many applications.  For example, if
% $\|(zI-A)^{-1}\| = 1/\varepsilon$ for some quantity $\varepsilon$, then
% there is a matrix $E$ with norm $\|E\| = \varepsilon$ such that $z$ is an
% eigenvalue of $A+E$.  This is the starting point of the theory of
% pseudospectra [1].

%%
% In particular, suppose all the eigenvalues of $A$ are in the left half
% of the complex plane, so that $A$ is stable in the sense that all solutions
% of the differential equation $\frac{du}{dt} = Au$ decay to zero
% as $t \to \infty$.  How small a perturbation matrix $E$ might make $A$
% unstable? The answer is $\|E\| = \varepsilon$, where $1/\varepsilon$ is the
% maximum of $\|(zI-A)^{-1}\|$ as $z$ ranges over the imaginary axis.
% Therefore in a number of fields such as control theory, there is special
% interest in the values taken by the norm of the resolvent on the imaginary
% axis.

%%
% Let's compute this function with Chebfun.  As an example we take the matrix
A = [-1 3 5 2; -3 -2 4 6; -5 -4 -2 1; -2 -6 -1 3]

%%
% A has two pairs of eigenvalues near the imaginary axis:
format short, format compact
eig(A)

%%
% Suppose $z=x+iy$.  It takes Chebfun a fraction of a second to compute a
% chebfun representing $\|(zI-A)^{-1}\|$ as a function of $y$, with $x=0$.
% Here is that calculation and a plot of the result:
I = eye(size(A));
nr = @(y) 1/min(svd(1i*y*I-A));
f = chebfun(nr,[-25,25],'vectorize');
LW = 'linewidth';
plot(f,LW,1.6), grid on

%%
% The maximum of $f$ is this,
format long
maxf = max(f)

%%
% and the distance to instability is the reciprocal of this quantity,
dist_sing = 1/maxf

%%
% Let us consider another example matrix, and this time, let's make an
% anonymous function to construct the chebfun.
normfun = @(A) chebfun(@(y) 1/min(svd(1i*y*eye(size(A))-A)),...
   1.5*norm(A)*[-1,1],'vectorize');

%%
% Here is a $5\times5$ matrix which we take to be complex, to break the
% symmetry:
B =  [ -3-2i   1+1i    -1i      0   -1+1i
           0  -2-3i    -1i     1i   -2-1i
          1i      0  -2-4i  -2-1i    2-1i
           0      1     1i  -2-4i      1i
        1-2i      0      1      1   -2-3i ];    
format short, eig(B)
%%
% And here is its resolvent norm plot:
fB = normfun(B);
plot(fB,LW,1.6), grid on
title(['maximum = ' num2str(max(fB))]);

%%
% Here are 12 random $6\times6$ complex matrices, all with rightmost
% eigenvalue having real part $-0.25$:
randn('seed',1)
for j = 1:12
    N = 6;
    A = randn(N) + 1i*randn(N) + 2i*diag(randn(N,1));
    abscissa = max(real(eig(A)));
    A = A - (abscissa+0.25)*eye(N);
    subplot(4,3,j)
    plot(normfun(A),LW,1)
    axis([-10 10 0 8]), drawnow
end
