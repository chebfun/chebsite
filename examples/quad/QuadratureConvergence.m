% As pointed out first by Folkmar Bornemann, the Gauss and Clenshaw-Curtis
% quadrature formulas converge at a rate one power of $n$ faster than one
% might expect.  For example, consider the function $f(x) = |x-.3|$.  Its
% Chebyshev coefficients decrease at the rate $n^{-2}$:
clf
x = chebfun('x');
f = abs(x-.3);
fc = chebfun(@(x) f(x),1e5);
LW = 'linewidth'; FS = 'fontsize'; MS = 'markersize';
chebpolyplot(fc,'loglog','.',MS,8), axis([1 1e5 1e-12 1])
xlabel('n',FS,12), ylabel('Chebyshev coefficient',FS,12)
nn = round(2.^(1:.5:16));
hold on, loglog(nn,.01*nn.^(-2),'--k',LW,2)
text(4e2,.5e-9,'n^{-2}',FS,18)

% Since the integral of an $O(n^{-2})$ tail is normally of size $O(n^{-1})$, you
% might expect these quadrature formulas to have accuracy $O(n^{-1})$. But
% in fact, it is $O(n^{-2})$ again:
clf, exact = sum(f);
errg = []; errc = [];
nn = round(2.^(1:.5:16));
for n = nn
  [s,w] = legpts(n);
  Igauss = w*f(s);
  errg = [errg abs(Igauss-exact)];
  [s,w] = chebpts(n);
  Iclenshawcurtis = w*f(s);
  errc = [errc abs(Iclenshawcurtis-exact)];
end

axis([1 1e5 1e-12 1]), hold on

% Xiang and Bornemann develop theorems that establish that this effect
% occurs generally [1].  The reason is not hard to explain once you know to
% look for it.  Both the Clenshaw-Curtis and Gauss formulas will integrate
% $T_m(x)$ incorrectly for $m\gg n$: instead of giving you the integral of
% $T_m$, they'll give you the integral of some lower-degree polynomial
% alias of $T_m$. But $T_m$ is highly oscillatory, with integral
% $O(n^{-1})$, and most of the time those aliases are highly oscillatory
% too, also with integral $O(n^{-1})$.  So the error committed in
% integrating $T_m$ is typically of size $O(n^{-1})$, not $O(1)$.  It's
% only as big as $O(1)$ for the unlucky values of $m$ that get aliased to a
% polynomial with a lot of energy at wave number $O(1)$, and only a
% fraction $O(n^{-1})$ of the values of $m$ have this unlucky property.

%%
% Or as Xiang and Bornemann put it: $E_n(T_m)$ is, up to some remainder,
% periodic in $m$ with a period of $O(n)$ and an _average_ modulus of
% $O(n^{-1})$.

%%
% Xiang and Bornemann point out that for a function with so little
% smoothness as $|x-.3|$, these convergence results were noted earlier by
% Riess and Johnson (1971/72) for Clenshaw-Curtis and Davis and Rabinowitz
% (1984) for Gauss.  The general theorems seem to be new, however, and
% their proofs require careful attention to details.
