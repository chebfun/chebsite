% Suppose you have a function f on an interval:
x = chebfun('x');
f = @(x) x.*sin(2*exp(2*sin(2*exp(2*x))));
fc = chebfun(f);
LW = 'linewidth'; FS = 'fontsize'; MS = 'markersize';
figure, plot(fc,LW,1.2)
title('Function f',FS,16)

%%
% In Chebfun you would normally compute the integral like this:
format long
Ichebfun = sum(fc)

%%
% Chebfun's method is Clenshaw-Curtis quadrature, i.e., the
% integration of the polynomial representing f by interpolation
% or piecewise interpolation in Chebyshev points.  Here is the
% number of quadrature points:
Npts = length(fc)

%%
% If we wanted, we could also perform the integration by
% explicitly extracting the Clenshaw-Curtis nodes and weights, like
% this:
[s,w] = chebpts(Npts);
Iclenshawcurtis = w*f(s)

%%
% Or we could try Gauss quadrature with the same number of
% points and weights.
[s,w] = legpts(Npts);
Igauss = w*f(s)

%% 
% Though this value of Npts is in the hundreds, Chebfun can
% handle values in the millions without difficulty.  This is
% achieved by the algorithm of Hale and Townsend [1].
% See Examples quad/GaussQuad.m.

%%
% Let's take a look at the accuracy as a function of Npts.
% Gauss quadrature converges geometrically, since f is analytic
% ([1], Theorem 19.3).

  [s,w] = chebpts(Npts);

% Clenshaw-Curtis quadrature also converges geometrically for
% analytic functions ([1], Theorem 19.3).
% In some circumstances Gauss converges
% up to twice as fast as C-C, with respect to Npts, but as
% this example suggests, the two formulas are often closer than
% that.  The computer time is often faster with C-C.
% For details of the comparison, see [2], [4], and Chapter 19 of [3].
