% *Orthogonal* polynomials are, as the name suggests, polynomials which
% are orthogonal to each other in some weighted $L^2$ inner product, i.e.,
%
% $$ \int_a^b |w(x)P_j(x)P_k(x) dx = \langle P_j, P_k \rangle = 0 $$
%
% for all $j\ne k$.
% If we normalise so that $\langle P_j, P_j \rangle = 1$, the polynomials
% are *orthonormal*.

%%
% Chebfun has commands built-in for some of the standard orthogonal
% polynomials. Here is a table of the polynomial, the weight function, the
% standard domain $[a,b]$, and the Chebfun routine name.
%
%      Name       |      w(x)      |   domain   | Chebfun routine
% ----------------------------------------------------------------
%     Legendre    |        1       |   [-1 1]   |  legpoly(N)
%  Chebyshev(1st) |  1/sqrt(1-x^2) |   [-1 1]   |  chebpoly(N)
%  Chebyshev(2nd) |   sqrt(1-x^2)  |   [-1 1]   |  chebpoly(N,2)
%     Laguerre    |     exp(-x)    |   [0 inf]  |  lagpoly(N)
%     Hermite     |    exp(-x^2)   | [-inf inf] |  hermpoly(N)

%%
% For each of these examples, there are readily derived recurrence
% relations which allow fast computation of the polynomials, and Chebfun
% exploits these. However, sometimes we wish to construct orthogonal
% polynomials with non-standard weight functions, and orthogonalisation
% via the Gram-Schmidt process is one method of doing so.

%%
% The process (sometimes referred to as the *Stieltjes process*)
% iteratively constructs the next degree polynomial by removing the
% components in the directions of the previous ones. The formula is
%
% $$ P_{k+1} = x^{k+1}-\sum\langle x^{k+1},P_j\rangle/\langle
% P_j,P_j \rangle P_j. $$
%%
% In practice one usually replaces $x^{k+1}$ by $x P_k(x)$ or the Chebyshev
% polynomial $T_{k+1}(x)$ to improve stability.

%%
% The short code below demonstrates these ideas by computing the first $5$
% orthonormal polynomials with respect to the weight function $w = e^{\pi x}$.
x = chebfun('x',[-1 1]);
w = exp(pi*x);
N = 5;
P = OrthPoly(w,N);

    function P = OrthPoly(w,N)
        if isnumeric(w), w = chebfun(w,[-1 1]); end
        d = w.ends;                     % the domain
        x = chebfun('x',d);             % linear chebfun
        P = chebfun(1./sqrt(sum(w)),d); % the constant (normalised)
        for k = 1:N;
            xk = x.*P(:,k);
            P(:,k+1) = xk;
            for j = 1:k       % Subtract out the components
                C = sum(w.*xk.*P(:,j));
                P(:,k+1) = P(:,k+1) - C*P(:,j);
            end
            P(:,k+1) = P(:,k+1)./sqrt(sum(w.*P(:,k+1).^2)); % normalise
        end
    end

% We can now plot these polynomials
LW = 'linewidth'; lw = 1.6; FS = 'fontsize';

% and confirm that they are orthogonal
W = repmat(w,1,N+1);
I = P'*(W.*P);
err = norm(I-eye(N+1))

%%
% One useful application of orthogonal polynomials is to find best polynomial
% approximations in weighted weighted $L^2$ inner-product space associated
% with $w(x)$, with
%
% $$  P^*_n = \sum \langle f, P_j \rangle P_j . $$
%%
% Here we do this with $w$ as above and approximate $f(x) = |x|$.
f = abs(x);
alpha = zeros(N+1,1);
for k = 0:N
    alpha(k+1) = sum(w.*P(:,k+1).*f);
end
P_star = P*alpha;

plot(f,'b',P_star,'--r',LW,lw)

%%
% Notice that the approximation is much closer for larger $x$, as $w(x) =
% \exp(\pi x)$ gives more weight to the error introduced there.
