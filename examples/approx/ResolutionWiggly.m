% One of the Chebfun team's favorite functions is this one, 
d = [0 14]; format compact
f = chebfun(@(x) sin(x).^2 + sin(x.^2), d);
LW = 'linewidth'; lw = 1.2;
hold off, plot(f, LW, lw, LW, lw), ylim([ - 2.5 2.5])

%%
% The degree of $f$ is of moderate size:
np = length(f)

%%
% It's interesting to see what happens when we compute approximations to $f$ of an
% intermediate degree. Let us arbitrarily choose the degree to be about half
% that of $f$:
nphalf = round(np/2)

%%
% Here is what happens with interpolation:
pinterp = chebfun(f, d, nphalf);
hold on, plot(pinterp, 'r', LW, lw), ylim([ - 2.5 2.5])
title('f and interpolant of half the degree')

%%
% It's clear from this figure that we have pretty good approximation on the
% left, where $f$ has low wave numbers, and not so good on the right.  A plot of
% the error confirms this:
hold off, plot(f - pinterp, 'k', LW, lw)
title('error of interpolant of half the degree')

%%
% Note that near the right-hand boundary the approximation improves again, 
% reflecting the fundamental phenomenon that polynomials have power
% approximation power near the endpoints of an interval than in the middle, as
% discussed in Chapter 22 of [1].

%%
% What will happen if we change the method of interpolation? For a start, here
% is what happens if we change from interpolation to least-squares:
pleastsq = polyfit(f, nphalf - 1);
plot(f, 'b', pleastsq, 'r', LW, lw), ylim([ - 2.5 2.5])
title('f and least - squares approximant of half the degree')

%%
% Qualitatively, the behavior is similar on the left half of the interval, but
% it is very different on the right half, where the least - squares approximant,
% unlike the interpolant, roughly tracks the low-wave - number signal. A plot of
% the error shows that its amplitude has approximately cut in half.
hold off, plot(f - pleastsq, 'k', LW, lw), ylim([ - 2.5 2.5])
title('error of least - squares approximant of half the degree')

%%
% Finally, here is what happens with best minimax approximation. Now we have beautifully
% smooth tracking of the low-wave-number signal on the right, but no accuracy at
% all on the left.
pbest = remez(f, nphalf - 1, 'maxiter', 100);
plot(f, 'b', pbest, 'r', LW, lw), ylim([ - 2.5 2.5])
title('f and best approximant of half the degree')

%%
% The error curve shows its familiar equioscillatory behavior -- with smaller
% maximum than the other methods, but no ability to take advantage of regions
% where the function is simpler.
hold off, plot(f - pbest, 'k', LW, lw), ylim([ - 2.5 2.5])

%%
% In summary, here is what we have observed:

%% 
% _Interpolation_: good for low wave numbers and near boundaries, meaningless for
% high wave numbers.

%% 
% _Least-squares_: good for low wave numbers and near boundaries, tracks the
% low-wave-number signal at high wave numbers.

%%
% _Minimax_: tracks the low-wave-number signal at high wave numbers, meaningless
% for low wave numbers.
