%% The Chebyshev-Legendre transform
% Chebfun is based on Chebyshev interpolants and their related fast algorithms.
% Chebyshev interpolants are a very practical tool for computing with smooth
% functions. However, in some situations Legendre expansions, i.e.,
%
% $$ p(x) = \sum_{n=0}^N c_n^{leg} P_n(x), $$
%
% where $P_n(x)$ is the degree $n$ Legendre polynomial, are desirable due to
% their orthogonality in the standard $L^2$ inner product. Recently, a new
% algorithm has been derived and implemented in Chebfun by Hale and Townsend
% that converts between $N$ Legendre and Chebyshev coefficients in
% $\mathcal{O}( N (\log N)^2/ \log \log N)$ operations [2]. The algorithm is
% based on a long-established asymptotic formula for Legendre polynomials [4],
% which was previously used in Chebfun's `legpts` command [1]. The transform
% comes in two parts: (1) The forward transform, `leg2cheb`, which converts
% Legendre to Chebyshev coefficients and (2) The inverse transform,
% `cheb2leg`, which converts in the other direction.

%%
% In this Example a few applications are considered.

%% Computing the Legendre coefficients
% The problem of computing the coefficients in a Legendre expansion of a
% function has received considerable research attention since the 1970s, and
% there are now many approaches (a summary is given [2]). In particular, any
% fast Chebyshev-Legendre transform can be used to compute the Legendre
% coefficients of a function by going via Chebyshev coefficients. For example,
% here are the Legendre coefficients of $1/(1+1000(x-.1)^2)$ using the new
% fast transform in Chebfun:

f = chebfun(@(x) 1./(1 + 1000*(x-.1).^2));  % A Runge-type function
c_cheb = chebcoeffs(f).';                     % Chebyshev coeffs in O(NlogN)
c_leg = cheb2leg(c_cheb);                   % Leg coeffs with the new algorithm

semilogy(flipud(abs(c_leg)), 'xr',MS,4), hold on  % plot them
semilogy(flipud(abs(c_cheb)), '.b', MS,8)
legend('Legendre coefficients','Chebyshev coefficients')
xlabel('n', FS, fs), set(gca, FS, fs), hold off

%%
% For an analytic function, the Legendre and Chebyshev coefficients decay at
% essentially the same geometric rate. However, for algebraically smooth
% functions the decay of Legendre coefficients is about $n^{-1/2}$ worse than
% that of the corresponding Chebyshev coefficients, a phenomenon discussed in
% [5].  Here we witness this disparity for the function $|x-.1|^{7/4}$:

f = chebfun(@(x) abs(x-.1).^(7/4)); N = length(f);  % |x-.1|^(7/4)
c_cheb = chebcoeffs(f)';                              % Chebyshev coeffs
c_leg = cheb2leg(c_cheb);                           % Legendre coeffs

semilogy(flipud(abs(c_leg)), 'xr',MS,4), hold on,         % plot them
semilogy(flipud(abs(c_cheb)), '.b',MS,8),
semilogy(1:N,(1:N).^(-7/4-1+.5), 'k--', LW, lw)
semilogy(1:N,(1:N).^(-7/4-1), 'k--', LW, lw)
legend('Legendre coefficients','Chebyshev coefficients',...
                'O(n^{-2.25})','O(n^{-2.75})')
xlim([0, N]), xlabel('n', FS, fs), set(gca, FS, fs), hold off

%%
% Note: A similar $n^{-1/2}$ discrepancy occurs for polynomial interpolation
% since the Lesbegue constant for Legendre points grows like $O(\sqrt{n})$
% while for Chebyshev points it grows like $O(\log n)$.

%% Fast evaluation of Legendre expansions
% Given a Legendre expansion, the fast transform can also be used to rapidly
% evaluate a Legendre series at Chebyshev points of the second kind. For
% example,

t = .999i; f = chebfun(@(x) 1./sqrt(1 - 2*x.*t +t.^2)); % generating function
N = length(f);
ns = sprintf('No. of evaluation points = %u\n',N);

s = tic;                                                % evaluate f
c_leg = t.^(N-1:-1:0);                                  % via Legendre coeffs
cheb_vals = chebtech2.coeffs2vals(leg2cheb(c_leg));     % and time it...
tt = toc(s);

ts = sprintf('Evaluation time = %1.2fs\n', tt);
fprintf([ns, ts])

semilogy(chebpts(length(f)), abs(f.values - cheb_vals.'))

%% Computing Legendre coefficients by a spectral method
% Recently, an ultraspherical spectral method was developed, which solves
% linear constant-coefficient ODEs in essentially $O(N)$ operations and
% computes the Chebyshev coefficients of the solution [3]. This approach
% easily generalises to a fast Legendre spectral method. Now that we have a
% fast transform, we can rapidly construct a chebfun object from the Legendre
% coefficients.

%%
% Let's solve a linear ODE that requires about $N=32000$ Legendre coefficients
% to resolve the solution. The ODE is
%
% $$ u''(x) + (10000\pi)^2u = 0, \qquad u(-1) = u(1) = 1, $$
%
% and hence, the solution is $\cos(10000\pi x)$.

tic
w = 10000*pi;                                  % solution is cos(wx)
f = chebfun(@(x) cos(w*x)); N = length(f)
D1 = spdiags(ones(N,1),1,N,N); D2 = 3*D1;      % diff operators
S1 = spdiags((.5./((0:N-1)'+.5)),0,N,N) -...
                              spdiags((.5./((0:N)'+.5)),2,N,N);
S2 = spdiags((1.5./((0:N-1)'+1.5)),0,N,N) -... % Conversion operators (see [3])
                              spdiags((1.5./((0:N)'+1.5)),2,N,N);
A = D2*D1 + w^2*S2*S1;                         % u''(x) + w^2u = 0;
A(end-1,:) = (-1).^(0:N-1);                    % left bc
A(end,:) = ones(1,N);                          % right bc
b = [zeros(N-2,1);f(-1);f(1)];                 % rhs
P = spdiags([(1:N-2) 1 1]',0,N,N);             % preconditioner
c_leg = flipud( (P*A) \ (P*b) );               % solve
toc

%%
% We can now form a chebfun from solution using `leg2cheb`:
tic
c_cheb = leg2cheb(c_leg);
u = chebfun(c_cheb, 'coeffs');
toc

clf, plot(u{-0.001,0.001}) % plot u on [-0.001, 0.001]

% Here is the error between the computed and the true solutions:
norm(c_cheb - chebcoeffs(f).', inf)
norm(u - f)

%% Conclusion
% The existence of a fast and practical Chebyshev-Legendre transform has many
% implications.  Within Chebfun, it has led to major speedups in the commands
% `conv` and `polyfit`.  Further developments are in the pipeline.
