% Many mathematical models exist for the spread of disease. This is partly
% because as epidemiology matured, more sophisticated models were developed.
% It is also because not all diseases spread in the same fashion. In this
% Example we explore some of the more well-known models of disease spread, all
% variants of the famous SIR model. All of the models presented are called
% "compartmental" because they group members of a population into compartments
% -- for example, "infected" and "uninfected" -- which interact according to a
% system of differential equations.

%%
% The systems of ODEs in this Example are initial value problems, and their
% solution on large domains is made possible by Chebfun's new IVP
% capabilities.


%% SIR model
% The most famous mathematical model of epidemics is the SIR model. This model
% groups members of a fixed population as susceptible (S), infected (I), or
% recovered (R). The dynamics dictate a one-way track: susceptible members may
% become infected, and infected individuals may recover, but that is all. So
% beginning with a nonzero number of infected people, then after enough time
% everyone ends up "recovered" (which is a word also used to mean "dead" -- R
% really refers to noninfectious, nonsusceptible people).

%%
% The model is a great simplification of how most diseases actually spread: it
% ignores incubation period; it assumes full contact among the whole
% population, ignoring geographic constraints; it assumes everyone is equally
% susceptible to the disease; and it treats the population as being continuous
% rather than discrete. Nevertheless, its assumptions about immunity make it a
% good model for measles, mumps, and rubella, which are all highly contagious
% diseases that infected people eventually develop an immunity to.

%%
% The SIR equations are
% $$ \frac{d S}{d t} = -c I S, $$
% $$ \frac{d I}{d t} = c I S - r I, $$
% $$ \frac{d R}{d t} = r I. $$
% The positive constants $c$ and $r$ are called the contact rate (or
% transmission rate) and recovery rate, and are determined empirically for a
% given disease. Looking at them for a while, you'll see that these equations
% all make sense intuitively. For example, the rate of increase of the
% population of "recovered" individuals is proportional to the size of
% infected individuals.

%%
% Here is a chebop for the SIR model.
contact_rate  = .003;
recovery_rate = .3;

op = @(x,S,I,R) [ ...
    diff(S) + contact_rate*I.*S
    diff(I) - contact_rate*I.*S + recovery_rate*I
    diff(R) - recovery_rate*I
    ];

N = chebop(op, [0,30]);

%%
% The initial conditions will be that out of population of 501 there is a
% single infected individual.
N.lbc = @(S,I,R) [ ...
        S - 500
        I - 1
        R
    ];

%%
% We will use chebop's nonlinear backslash syntax to solve the problem. The
% `deal` method allows the solution components (which are returned as a
% chebmatrix) to be dealt to multiple outputs.
[S,I,R] = deal(N\0);

%%
% Here is a plot of the solution.

%%
% So beginning from a small fraction of infected people, eventually the entire
% population gets the disease and recovers (or dies). Notice that if $I(0)=0$,
% the solution component for $I$ would be the steady function $I(t)=0$, which
% is an unstable (and biologically accurate) equilibrium of the system.

%%
% The model wouldn't be very realistic if the population size varied over
% time, so let us verify that it is constant.

%%
% It can also be seen from the differential equations that the population is
% constant by adding the equations together.

%%
% What is the largest number of people infected at a particular time?
round(max(I))
%%
% Nearly half the population! At what time is the number of infected
% people equal to the number of recovered people?

plot(t_eq, I(t_eq), 'k.', MS, 15)
%%
% Chebfun makes such computations embarrassingly easy.
%%
% What about the instantaneous mortality rate? A natural measure of
% mortality rate is
% $$ M(t) = \frac{\rho R(t)}{\int_0^t I(\xi) d\xi}, $$
% where $0\leq\rho\leq 1$ denotes the average fraction of people who die from
% the disease. That is, the mortality rate at time $t$ is the number of
% dead people over the total number of people who have been infected up
% to time $t$. Here is the instantaneous mortality rate as a function of time.
hold off
rho = .4;                   % 40 percent of infected people die
plot(rho*R./cumsum(I))      % The instantaneous mortality rate
ylim([0 1])
xlabel('t')
title('Instantaneous mortality rate for the SIR model')
%%
% It turns out that $M(t)$ is constant and equal to $\rho r$, the product of
% $\rho$ with the recovery rate.
%%
% For this model, it is perhaps unsurprising that the instantaneous mortality
% rate is constant. But it is important to note that in reality that is not
% always true. In the case of the current Ebola outbreak in West Africa, for
% instance, other factors are at play to make the transmission rate $c$
% variable, actually an increasing function of time. When the transmission
% rate $c$ is increasing so $dc(t)/dt > 0$, the number of infected people
% increases faster than the already-infected people have a chance to die, so
% the instantaneous mortality rate actually _decreases_. Once the infection
% levels peak, however, the mortality rate skyrockets.


%% SIR with vital dynamics
% The SIR model described above encounters problems when imposed on a long
% time horizen. In particular, it assumes that members of the population
% stick around forever. A modified version of the SIR model accounts for
% the _vital dynamics_ -- that is, birth and death -- of members of the
% population.
%%
% SIR with vital dynamics still assumes a constant population size, but it
% includes a birth rate and death rate (of equal magnitude) that assures that
% members of the population are replaced by susceptible individuals over time.
% The equations are
% $$ \frac{d S}{d t} = \mu N - \mu S - \frac{c}{N} I S, $$
% $$ \frac{d I}{d t} = \frac{c}{N} I S - (r+\mu) I, $$
% $$ \frac{d R}{d t} = r I - \mu R, $$
% where $\mu$ is the birth and death rate and $N$ is the total population
% size. The other constants have changed to account for the fact that the
% total population size is worked into the equations.

N = 501;
birth_rate    = .08;
contact_rate  = 7;
recovery_rate = 3;

op = @(x,S,I,R) [ ...
    diff(S) - birth_rate*N + birth_rate*S + contact_rate/N*I.*S
    diff(I) - contact_rate/N*I.*S + (recovery_rate+birth_rate)*I
    diff(R) - recovery_rate*I + birth_rate*R
    ];

N = chebop(op, [0,50]);

%%
% Let's keep the same initial conditions as before.
N.lbc = @(S,I,R) [ ...
        S - 500
        I - 1
        R
    ];

%%
% What does the solution look like now?
[S,I,R] = deal(N\0);

plot([S I R])
legend('S','I','R')
title('SIR model with vital dynamics')
xlabel('t')

%%
% And again we can verify that the population is constant.
norm(diff(S+I+R))

%%
% The vital dynamics introduce two qualitative changes in the solution.
% First, the solution components are no longer unimodal. Because the population
% becomes susceptible again over time, there are intermittent outbreaks of the
% disease, which eventually stabilize. Second, the steady state as $t\to\infty$
% does not result in everyone being "recovered". Because of the birth/death
% cycle, the steady state is that there is a constant _nonzero_ number of
% susceptible and infected people.


%% SEIR
% The SEIR model expands upon the SIR model by adding an intermediate
% compartment ("exposed") for people who have been infected but are not
% themselves infectious yet. The "exposed" category is significant for
% diseases like influenza that have an incubation period.

%%
% The equations of the SEIR model are
% $$ \frac{d S}{d t} = \mu N - \mu S - \frac{c}{N} I S, $$
% $$ \frac{d E}{d t} = \frac{c}{N} I S - (a+\mu) E, $$
% $$ \frac{d I}{d t} = aE - (r+\mu) I, $$
% $$ \frac{d R}{d t} = r I - \mu R, $$
% where $a^{-1}$ is the average incubation period of the contagion.

N = 501;
birth_rate        = .08;
incubation_period = 5;
contact_rate      = 8;
recovery_rate     = 3;

op = @(x,S,E,I,R) [ ...
    diff(S) - birth_rate*N + birth_rate*S + contact_rate/N*I.*S
    diff(E) - contact_rate/N*I.*S + (incubation_period+birth_rate)*E
    diff(I) - incubation_period*E + (recovery_rate+birth_rate)*I
    diff(R) - recovery_rate*I + birth_rate*R
    ];

N = chebop(op, [0,30]);

%%
% We will modify the initial conditions so that a single person is
% _exposed_ but not yet infectious.
N.lbc = @(S,E,I,R) [ ...
        S - 500
        E - 1
        I
        R
    ];

%%
% Here is the solution to the SEIR model.
[S,E,I,R] = deal(N\0);

plot([S E I R])
legend('S','E','I','R')
title('SEIR model with vital dynamics')
xlabel('t')

%%
% And once more, verify the total population is constant:
norm(diff(S+E+I+R))


%% Other models
% There are endless variants of the basic SIR model to include factors like
% passive immunity, variable transmission rates, stochastic processes, noise,
% external factors (like the mosquitoe population in the case of malaria),
% geographic setting, and so on.
