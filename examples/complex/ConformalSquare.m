% An analytic function creates a conformal map between regions of the
% complex plane. These maps distort lengths but exactly preserve all
% angles. These maps turn out to be useful in some classical physics
% applications, most notably those using the 2D Laplace equation.

%%
% While analytic functions, and hence conformal maps, are hardly rare,
% finding the conformal map between two given regions is an old and
% interesting problem. A major breakthrough was discovered in the 1860's
% simultaneously by Schwarz and Christoffel and is known now as the
% Schwarz-Christoffel formula.

%%
% Let $f(z)$ be the map from the interior of the unit disk to the interior
% of a region bounded by a polygon with $n$ vertices. Then

%%
% \[  f'(z) = c \prod_{k=1}^n \left(1-\frac{z}{z_k}\right)^{\alpha_k-1}  \]

%%
% In this formula, the points $z_1,\ldots,z_n$ are the inverse images of
% the vertices (or _prevertices_) of the polygon, and the interior angles
% of the polygon are given by $\pi\alpha_1,\ldots,\pi\alpha_n$.

%%
% One cannot choose the prevertices arbitrarily in general, as they are
% nonlinearly constrained by the side lengths of the target polygon.
% However, symmetry is often useful at reducing the difficulty of this
% problem. If the target region is a square, then we can impose fourfold
% symmetry on the prevertices as well:
zpre = [ 1, 1i, -1, -1i ];

%%
% Given the prevertices, and the fact that $\alpha_k=1/2$ for each $k$, we
% now can compute the derivative of the map anywhere:
fprime = @(z) ( (1-z/zpre(1)).*(1-z/zpre(2)).*(1-z/zpre(3)).*(1-z/zpre(4)) ).^(-0.5);

%%
% Now we'll integrate $f'$ to get the mapping along the ray [0,1].
z = chebfun('z',[0 1]);
w = cumsum( fprime(z) )

%%
% In fact, the resulting expression is essentially real.
zcirc = exp(1i*chebfun('t',[0 2*pi]));
subplot(1,2,1), LW = 'linewidth'; MS = 'markersize';
plot(zcirc,'k',LW,2)
hold on, plot(zpre,'r.',MS,20)
axis equal, axis(1.05*[-1 1 -1 1]), axis off
plot(real(z),imag(z),'b',LW,1.5)
subplot(1,2,2)
plot(w,'b',LW,1.5)
hold on, axis equal, axis(1.35*[-1 1 -1 1]), axis off

%%
% Now we'll start to make things interesting by integrating along different
% rays from the origin. We have to account for the direction of the ray in
% our integration, through the relation $\int f'(z)\,dz = \int f'(z(r))\,
% z'(r)\,dr$.
for t = linspace(0,2*pi,33)
    z = chebfun('r',[0 1])*exp(1i*t);
    subplot(1,2,1), plot(real(z),imag(z),'b',LW,1.5)
    subplot(1,2,2), plot( cumsum(fprime(z)*exp(1i*t)), 'b',LW,1.5 )
end

%%
% It's now apparent that the square is turned so that the corners point in
% the compass directions.
subplot(1,2,2)
plot(w(1)*zpre([1:4 1]),'k--',LW,2), plot(w(1)*zpre,'r.',MS,20)

%%
% Except for the rays that end at corners, each one makes a perfect right
% angle with the boundary of the square.

%%
% We finish the picture by plotting the images of circles of different
% radii. We have to use the chain rule to account for integrating over the
% curved paths. We also have to account for the integration constant, which
% was implicitly defined by f(0)=0, by using the value of w we computed
% along the first ray.
for r = [.5 .6 .7 .8 .9 .97]
    z = r*zcirc;
    f = w(r) + cumsum( fprime(z).*diff(z) );
    subplot(1,2,1), plot(z,'b',LW,1.5)
    subplot(1,2,2), plot(f,'b',LW,1.5)
end


%%
% Thanks to conformality, both networks of curves make orthogonal
% intersections.

%%
% The boundary is interesting. The map can't be conformal there, because
% the smooth curve obtains 90 degree corners. In fact, this observation
% shows that the mapping will have square-root singularities at those
% points. Nevertheless, Chebfun's built-in integration is able to handle
% those singularities, because we constructed them from smooth Chebfun
% objects.
f = w(1) + cumsum( fprime(zcirc).*diff(zcirc) );
subplot(1,2,2), plot(f,'k',LW,2)
