%%
% Newton's method, as the most fundamental root-finding algorithm, usually
% appears no later than Chapter 2 in most numerical analysis textbooks. It
% uses the first two terms of the Taylor series of a function $f(x)$ in the
% vicinity of a suspected root to find successively better approximations
% to the root, using the formula $$ x^{(k+1)} = x^{(k)} - {f(x^{(k)})\over
% f'(x^{(k)})}. $$
%
% Let's consider $f(x) = x^3-3x^2+2$, which has several roots, as we see in
% the next plot.

LW = 'linewidth'; lw = 2;
MS = 'MarkerSize'; ms = 18;
dom = [-3 3];
f = chebfun('x.^3-3*x.^2+2', dom);
plot(f, LW, lw), hold on
plot(dom, [0 0], 'k'), hold off

% Here are the roots.

%%
% If we try to locate the leftmost root by Newton's method, we need to pick
% an initial guess, for example $-3$.

fprime = diff(f);
d = norm(f,inf);
tol = 1e-8;
xold = -2;
x = [];
i = 0;

plot(f, LW, lw), xlim([-2.5 0]), hold on
plot(dom, [0 0], 'k')
while(d > tol)
    x = [x xold];
    xnew = xold - f(xold)/fprime(xold);
    d = abs(xnew - xold);
    
    plot(xold, f(xold), 'ok')
    strx = ['x_{' num2str(i) '}'];
    text(xold - 0.05, 1.2, strx,'fontsize',12)
    plot(xold, 0, '.k', MS, ms)
    plot([xold xold], [0 f(xold)], '--k', LW, lw)
    plot([xold xnew], [f(xold) 0], '-.k', LW, lw)
       
    xold = xnew;
    i = i+1;
end

% In the above plot, the solid black dots are the successive approximations
% of the root, while the circles are their projections on the curve, from
% which the Newton's method locates the next approximation along the
% tangent (black dash-dot lines). The following table tells us with no
% surprise that Newton's method is quadratically convergent.

n = size(x,2);
res = abs(x - xnew);
LogRes = log(res);

disp('iterations     Logarithm of the step size')
for i = 1:n
    fprintf('%5d  %25.8f\n', i, LogRes(i))
end

%%
% You may expect that the same order of convergence to appear when we
% approximate the middle root in this example.

d = norm(f,inf);
xold = 0.5;
x = [];
while(d > tol)
    x = [x xold];
    xnew = xold - f(xold)/fprime(xold);
    d = abs(xnew - xold);
    xold = xnew;
end
hold off
root2 = xnew

n = size(x,2);
res = abs(x - xnew);
LogRes = log(res);

disp('iterations     Logarithm of the step size')
for i = 1:n
    fprintf('%5d  %25.8f\n', i, LogRes(i))
end

% But now, this time we are evidently achieving cubic convergence! Is there
% something wrong? No, this makes perfect sense, if you notice that
% $f^{''}(1) = 0$ in this example.
