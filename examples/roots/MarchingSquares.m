%% 
% In Chebfun2 we would like to be able to find the roots of a bivariate
% polynomial system.  That is, find $(x,y)$ such that
%
% $$ F(x,y) =  ( f(x,y), g(x,y) ) = 0. $$ 
%
% A suggestion by John Boyd of the University of Michigan for finding the zeros
% of a system of polynomials goes by the name of Marching Triangles [5]. This
% works by determining the zero contours of $f$ and $g$ separately, and to
% achieve this the algorithm subdivides the domain many small triangles.  On
% each triangle it approximates $f$ (or $g$) by a piecewise linear polynomial,
% and there are two possible cases:
%
% (1) The values of the function at the vertices are all of the same sign. 
%
% (2) One function value is of a different sign to the others. 
%%
% If (1) holds then the triangle is marked as not containing a zero contour. If
% (2) holds, then a linear polynomial $p(x) = ax + by + c$ is formed which
% interpolates the three vertices and the zero contour of $f$ in that triangle
% is approximated by the zero line of $p(x)$.  Further subdivision is taken in
% triangles which are deemed to contain a zero contour.

%%
% The MATLAB command `contourc` uses Marching Squares [4],
% a similar technique but
% subdividing with squares instead of triangles. This algorithm is employed by
% `contour`, `contours` and `contourf` and implemented in `contourc`.
% One of the Chebfun Examples is based on the `contourc` command [1].

%%
% The Chebfun2 `roots` command uses the MATLAB `contourc` command to find
% the zero contours of a single function $f(x,y)$.

%% Zero contours
% Let's solve a problem from [2] of finding
% the solution to $f(x,y) = g(x,y) = 0$:
d = [-4 4 -4 4]; 
f = chebfun2(@(x,y) 2*y.*cos(y.^2).*cos(2*x)-cos(y),d);
g = chebfun2(@(x,y) 2*sin(y.^2).*sin(2*x)-sin(x),d);

%% 
% This example was derived from an autonomous system of ODEs.
% Here are the zero contours computed by Marching Squares.
LW = 'linewidth'; lw = 1.6; MS = 'markersize';
plot(roots(g),'r',LW,lw), hold on, plot(roots(f),'g',LW,lw)

%% Solutions to bivariate systems
% A different problem is to find the isolated solutions to a bivariate system
% $f(x,y) = g(x,y) = 0$. The Chebfun2 command
% `roots(f,g)` solves this problem by
% first computing the zero contours of $f$ and $g$ by marching squares, and then
% using their intersections as initial guesses in a Newton iteration.

%% 
% For example we can find all the solutions to the example above with the
% following code:
r = roots([f;g],'ms'); 
plot(r(:,1),r(:,2),'.k',MS,20), hold off

%% 
% (Note: The `roots` command in Chebfun2 uses two different algorithms,
% one based on a hidden variable resultant method
% and the other on Marching Squares. The 'ms' 
% flag ensures that the Marching Squares algorithm is employed.
% For more information type `help chebfun2v/roots.m`.)

%% Trott's curve
% Trott's curve an important curve in algebraic geometry.  Here we use the
% command `roots(f,g)` to compute the intersections between this curve and the
% zero contours of $f(x,y) = y-x^6$.

trott = @(x,y) 144*(x.^4+y.^4)-225*(x.^2+y.^2) + 350*x.^2.*y.^2+81;
f = chebfun2(trott); 
g = chebfun2(@(x,y) y-x.^6); 
plot(roots(f),'b',LW,lw), hold on, plot(roots(g),'r',LW,lw), axis equal
r = roots([f;g],'ms'); 
plot(r(:,1),r(:,2),'k.',MS,20), hold off

%% A function with several local minima
% The `roots` command in Chebfun2 can also be used
% to compute the local extrema of
% a function $f(x,y)$ because they satisfy $df/dx = df/dy = 0$.
f = chebfun2(@(x,y) (x.^2-y.^3+1/8).*sin(10*x.*y));
r = roots(gradient(f),'ms');             % critical points
plot(roots(diff(f,1,2)),'b',LW,lw)       % plot zero contours of f_x
hold on, plot(roots(diff(f)),'r',LW,lw)  % plot zero contours of f_y
plot(r(:,1),r(:,2),'k.',MS,20)           % plot extrema

%% 
% Note that we have used the Chebfun2 `gradient` command, which
% computes the $x$ and $y$ derivatives of $f$.

%% More information 
% The last example can also be found in [3] along with additional information
% about the rootfinding algorithm in Chebfun2.
