%%
% This example was inspired by a discussion with Paul Constantine [1].

%%
% Let the ODE boundary-value problem
%
% $$  (a(x,s)u')' = 1,\qquad   u(0) = u(1) = 0, $$
%
% be given, where
%
% $$  a(x,s) = 1+4s(x^2-x) $$
%
% and the prime denotes differentiation with respect to $x$.
% The exact solution can be shown to be
%
% $$ u(x,s) = {1\over 8s} \log(1+4s(x^2-x)) = {1\over 8s} \log(a(x,s)) . $$
%
% It is clear that for $s=1$, the solution has a singularity at $x=1/2$.
% Here, we explore what happens when we solve the problem for values of $s$
% getting closer and closer to the critical value $s=1$.

%% Setting up the problem
%
% We begin by rewriting the differential equation in the form
%
% $$ a(x,s)u'' + a'(x,s)u' = 1, $$
%
% as it will be simpler to work with. We now set up anonymous functions to
% represent $a$ and $a'$,
a =  @(x,s) 1 + 4*s*(x.^2-x);
ap = @(x,s) 4*s*(2*x-1);

%%
% as well as anonymous functions for the exact solution and the chebfun
% $x$ on the interval [0,1]:
uexact = @(x,s) log(a(x,s)) / (8*s);
chebx = chebfun('x',[0 1]);

%%
% We can now set up a chebop to represent the boundary-value
% problem operator. However, since
% we want to explore what the solution looks like for different values of
% $s$, we define the chebop as an anonymous function as well (whose output
% will be a chebop). The two last arguments correspond to imposing
% homogeneous Dirichlet conditions on the solution.
Ns = @(s) chebop(@(x,u) a(x,s).*diff(u,2) + ap(x,s).*diff(u),[0 1], 0, 0);

%%
% Since we want to take values of $s$ closer and closer to
% $1$, we rewrite $s$ in the form
%
% $$ s = 1-10^{-\gamma}, $$
%
% where $\gamma$ takes integer values (giving $s=0.9,0.99,0.999,\dots$). We
% thus define $s$ as an anonymous function
s = @(gamma) 1-10^(-gamma);

%%
% We can then obtain the solution of the problem for different values
% of $\gamma$. Again, we use anonymous functions to achieve the desired
% effect.
ugamma = @(gamma) solvebvp(Ns(s(gamma)),1);

%%
% Here, the `solvebvp` method is another way to call the chebop backslash
% method. The second argument corresponds to the right-hand side of the
% differential equation.

%% Solutions for different values of $\gamma$
% We're now all set to solve the problem for different values of $\gamma$. 
res = []; error = [];
LW = 'linewidth'; FS = 'fontsize';
ax = [0 1 -2.2 0.2];
for gamma = 1:3
    solgamma = ugamma(gamma);
    plot(solgamma,LW,1.6)
    ss = sprintf('gamma = %1d    length(solution) = %4d',gamma,length(solgamma));
    title(ss,FS,12), axis(ax), grid on, snapnow
    res(gamma) = norm(feval(Ns(s(gamma)),solgamma)-1);
    error(gamma) = norm(solgamma - uexact(chebx,s(gamma)));
end

%%
% Here we are required to use the `feval` method to evaluate the residual
% since MATLAB doesn't allowing double indexing, i.e. we can't call
% `Ns(s(gamma))(solgamma)`.

%%
% Values of $\gamma$ up to 3 work fine, but the lenghts of the
% solutions are increasing.

%%
% Looking at the entries in the vector storing the values of the residual
% reveals that they grow extremely fast with $\gamma$.
semilogy(1:3,res,'-*m',LW,1.6), grid on
title('Norm of residual',FS,12), xlabel('\gamma',FS,12)

%%
% However, the error remains much better under control:
semilogy(1:3,error,'-*r',LW,1.6), grid on
title('Norm of error',FS,12), xlabel('\gamma',FS,12)

%% Introducing a breakpoint
%
% The plot above of the solutions for different values of $\gamma$ reveals
% that the solution gets more and more difficult to represent close to $x=
% 1/2$ as $\gamma$ increases (i.e., $s$ gets closer to $1$).
% This makes a good case
% for introducing a breakpoint in the solution at $x=1/2$, so rather than
% the solution being represented by a global chebfun, it is represented by
% two pieces.

%%
% We introduce a breakpoint in the operator as follows (notice the second
% argument to the chebop constructor):
Nsbreak = @(s) chebop(@(x,u) a(x,s).*diff(u,2)+ap(x,s).*diff(u),[0 .5 1],0,0);

%%
% We now redefine the anonymous function which gives the solution.
ugammabreak = @(gamma) solvebvp(Nsbreak(s(gamma)),1);

%%
% We're now all set to solve the problem using breakpoints for different
% values of $\gamma$. Here, values of $\gamma$ up to 6 work with the default
% chebop settings.
chebx = chebfun('x',[0 0.5 1]);
res = []; error = []; legs = [];
for gamma = 1:7
    solgamma = ugammabreak(gamma);
    plot(solgamma,LW,1.6)
    ss = sprintf('gamma = %1d    length(solution) = %4d',gamma,length(solgamma));
    title(ss,FS,12), axis(ax), grid on, snapnow
    res(gamma) = norm(feval(Nsbreak(s(gamma)),solgamma)-1);
    error(gamma) = norm(solgamma - uexact(chebx,s(gamma)));
end

%%
% Again, the errors are quite satisfactory.
semilogy(1:7,error,'-*r',LW,1.6), grid on
title('Norm of error',FS,12), xlabel('\gamma',FS,12)
