%% Introduction
% The above problem was posed by Trefethen [1] to students
% as an extension of a similar problem
% made famous by the great Martin Gardner in 1957, for whom the
% particles were instead bugs that begun on the corners of a square.

%%
% Here is a diagram of the rectangle version of the problem,
% which we will use Chebfun to solve. What paths
% will the bugs take, and when will they collide?

%% The system of ODEs
% For notational and computational convenience, we will
% place the bugs on the corners of a $2\times1$ rectangle
% centered at the origin in the complex plane. By symmetry,
% bugs 1 and 3 will follow the same path rotated $180^{\circ}$,
% and so will 2 and 4. Thus the bugs will always form a
% parallelogram centered at the origin as they converge.

%%
% The system of ODEs that describes the motion of the bugs
% is derived as follows. We denote the position of bug $k$
% as $z_k$ and the lengths of the sides of the parallelogram
% they form as $\ell_1$ and $\ell_2$. We let $\theta$ denote the
% internal angle formed by $z_2$ and its neighbors and $\phi$
% the orientation of the system, equal to $\arg(z_2 - z_1)$.
% Now a system of ODEs governing the dance of the bugs
% may be written down [1]:
%%
% $$ \frac{\mathrm{d}z_1}{\mathrm{d}t} = \frac{z_2 - z_1}{|z_2 - z_1|}, \qquad
% \frac{\mathrm{d}z_2}{\mathrm{d}t} = \frac{- z_2 - z_1}{|z_2 + z_1|}, $$
%%
% $$ \ell_1 \mathrm{e}^{\mathrm{i}\phi} = z_2 - z_1, \qquad
% \ell_2 \mathrm{e}^{\mathrm{i}(\phi-\theta)} = z_1 + z_2. $$
%%
% However, it will be more convenient for us to work in an
% equivalent system in the variables $\ell_1, \ell_2, \phi, \theta$:
%%
% $$ \frac{\mathrm{d}\ell_1}{\mathrm{d}t} = -1 - \cos\theta, \qquad
% \frac{\mathrm{d}\ell_2}{\mathrm{d}t} = -1 + \cos\theta, $$
%%
% $$ \frac{\mathrm{d}\theta}{\mathrm{d}t} = \left( \frac{1}{\ell_1}
%     - \frac{1}{\ell_2} \right) \sin\theta, \qquad
% \frac{\mathrm{d}\phi}{\mathrm{d}t} = \frac{\sin\theta}{\ell_1}. $$

%%
% The question of when the bugs collide is ready to be answered.
% If we add the derivatives of the side lengths, we find
% that $\frac{\mathrm{d}\ell_1}{\mathrm{d}t} - \frac{\mathrm{d}\ell_2}{\mathrm{d}t} = -2$,
% indicating that the rate of change of the
% perimeter of the parallelogram (twice the above) is the constant $-4$.
% The perimeter begins as $6$, so after exactly $1.5$ time units the
% bugs should collide at the origin.

%%
% However, there is much more
% to this problem than just the final collision time!

%% Solution with Chebfun
% We can set up the bugs' dance as a system of ODEs in Chebfun
% to be solved with Chebfun's overload of ODE113:
interval = [-1.5, -.01]; % There is a singularity at t = 0.
opts = odeset('abstol', 5e-14, 'reltol', 5e-14);
fun = @(t, u) ... % u = [theta, phi, ell1, ell2]
      [ (1./u(3)-1./u(4)).*sin(u(1));
        sin(u(1))./u(3);
        -cos(u(1))-1;
        cos(u(1))-1 ];
initial_conds = [pi/2, pi/2, 1, 2];
u = chebfun.ode113(fun, interval, initial_conds, opts);

%%
% The variable `u` is now a 4-column quasimatrix containing
% the solution to the system of differential equations.
% With some simple transformations we can reconstruct the
% paths of the four bugs in the complex plane.
theta = u(:,1);  phi = u(:,2);  ell1 = u(:,3);  ell2 = u(:,4);
bugs      = ( ell2.*exp(1i*(phi-theta)) - ell1.*exp(1i*phi) )/2;
bugs(:,2) = ( ell2.*exp(1i*(phi-theta)) + ell1.*exp(1i*phi) )/2;
bugs(:,3) = -bugs(:,1);  bugs(:,4) = -bugs(:,2);  bugs(:,5) = bugs(:,1);

% As explained above, the bugs always form a parallelogram
% as they converge. What is less obvious is how the
% parallelogram transforms as the bugs approach the origin.

%% Computing critical times
% The exposition in [1] also includes discussion of critical times
% at which the bugs form special shapes. In particular,
% at each $t\in t_\mathrm{rect}$ the bugs form a rectangle, and
% at each $t\in t_\mathrm{rhomb}$ the bugs form a rhombus.
% (The bugs form these shapes infinitely many times,
% but after the first few steps of their dance, the spatial scale
% has shrunk so much that we cannot hope to compute exact
% time values on a computer using this method.)
% Here is one way to find the first two times in $t_\mathrm{rect}$
% using Chebfun. We can construct a chebfun to test the orthogonality
% of the parallelogram at any
% point in time. The roots of that function will then
% correspond to the times at which the bugs form a rectangle.
F_rect = chebfun(@(t) theta(t)-pi/2, interval);
t_rect_exact  = [-1.5; -0.148243863926]; % from Chapman et al. [1]
t_rect_est = roots(F_rect);              % Chebfun estimates
fprintf('{t_rect} exact (Chapman et al.):    %-2.16f    %-16.12f\n', t_rect_exact)
fprintf('{t_rect} estimated by Chebfun:      %-2.16f    %-16.16f\n', t_rect_est)

%%
% Our second computed answer agrees to every digit with the time given in [1],
% and there is a chance that Chebfun has does even better. (The tolerance of
% the ODE solver was set to 5e-14, so in fact we should expect that
% Chebfun has done one digit better.)

%%
% If we construct a similar chebfun to test the equality of the
% parallelogram's side lengths, then its roots will correspond to
% the times when the bugs form a rhombus.
F_rhomb = chebfun(@(t) sum(diff(abs(bugs(t,1:4) - bugs(t,2:5)))), ...
            interval, 'vectorize');
t_rhomb_exact = [-0.328190029216; -0.011365703053]; % from Chapman et al. [1]
t_rhomb_est = roots(F_rhomb);                       % Chebfun estimates
fprintf('{t_rhomb} exact (Chapman et al.):    %-19.12f    %-12.12f\n', t_rhomb_exact)
fprintf('{t_rhomb} estimated by Chebfun:      %-16.16f    %-16.16f\n', t_rhomb_est)

%%
% Again, Chebfun gives an answer correct to as many digits as are
% available.

%%
% Let us plot the special configurations.
% First, the first rhombus:
tt = sort([t_rect_est, t_rhomb_est]);
plot(bugs, 'interval', [-1.5 tt(3)], LW, 2), hold on
plot(bugs(tt(3),:), 'k.-', MS, 18), hold off
axis equal, zoom(1.8), axis off
title(['rhombus, t = ' num2str(tt(3),10)], FS, 12)

%%
% Now the second rectangle:
plot(bugs, 'interval', [-1.5 tt(2)], LW, 2), hold on
plot(bugs(tt(2),:), 'k.-', MS, 18), hold off
axis equal, zoom(4.4), axis off
title(['rectangle, t = ' num2str(tt(2),10)], FS, 12)

%%
% Finally, the second rombus, flattened nearly to one dimension.
plot(bugs, 'interval', [-1.5 tt(4)], LW, 2), hold on
plot(bugs(tt(4),:), 'k.-', MS, 18), hold off
axis equal, zoom(52), axis off
title(['rhombus, t = ' num2str(tt(4),10)], FS, 12)
