% The final problem for Oxford's Numerical Analysis
% Problem Solving Squad this year was the following:
%%
% A needle of length $1$ rests on a surface defined
% by the height function
%%
% $$ h(x) = 0.1 x^2 + 0.1\sin(6x) + 0.03\sin(12x). $$
%%
% What is the lowest possible height of the centre
% of the needle?

%%
% Let's begin with a picture:
LW = 'linewidth'; FS = 'fontsize'; MS = 'markersize';
s = chebfun('s',[-4 4]);
h = .1*s.^2 + .1*sin(6*s)+.03*sin(12*s);
close all, plot(h,LW,1), axis equal, axis([-4 4 -.4 2])

%%
% We see immediately that the optimal position of
% the center of the needle, call it $x$, will lie
% in $[-2,2]$.  Actually it's pretty clear it will
% lie in $[-1,1]$.

%%
% This is obviously an optimization problem, but exactly
% how should we formulate it?  One interpretation is that it
% is a problem of _semiinfinite programming_, because it
% mixes an objective function to minimize with a continuum
% of constraints.  Presumably there are methods that could be
% used to solve it in this framework.

%%
% For us, when I hear the word "continuum", we think Chebfun.
% Suppose we specify two variables: $x$, the horizontal
% position of the center of the needle, and $\theta$, its angle
% counterclockwise from the horizontal.  Given $x$ and $\theta$, we
% then ask how low the needle can lie.  Let
%%
% $$ y(x,\theta) $$
%%
% be its minimal height, given that it does not cut below the surface.
% Then $y(x,\theta)$ is just a maximum of a continuous function
% over an interval, which we can compute with Chebfun like this:

function y = minfun(x,theta)
r = .5*cos(theta); hx = h{x-r,x+r};
needle = chebfun(@(s) tan(theta)*(s-x),[x-r x+r]);
y = max(hx-needle);
end

%%
% And here is a function for plotting a particular configuration:

function plotneedle(x,theta)
y = minfun(x,theta);
r = .5*cos(theta); hx = h{x-r,x+r};
needle = chebfun(@(s) y+tan(theta)*(s-x),[x-r x+r]);
hold off, plot(h,'b',needle,'k',LW,1)
axis equal, axis([-4 4 -.4 2])
end

%%
% For example, here are needle positions for
% $(x,\theta) = (-.6, -0.2)$ and
% $(x,\theta) = (1.7, 1)$.
subplot(2,1,1)
plotneedle(-0.6,-0.2), title('needle with (x,theta) = (-.6, -0.2)',FS,14)
subplot(2,1,2)
plotneedle(1.7,1), title('needle with (x,theta) = (1.7, 1)',FS,14)

%%
% Now we just have to minimize over $x$ and $\theta$.
% Let's first do that over a wide range.
npts = 25;
tic, x = linspace(-2,2,npts);
theta = linspace(-1.5,1.5,npts);
[xx,thth] = meshgrid(x,theta); yy = 0*xx;
for k = 1:length(x)
  for j = 1:length(theta)
    yy(j,k) = minfun(xx(j,k),thth(j,k));
  end
end
close, contour(x,theta,yy,80), grid on, xlabel('x',FS,14), ylabel('theta',FS,14)
colorbar, title(['min value on grid: ' num2str(min(yy(:)))],FS,14), toc

%%
% In this picture we see that there are two promising
% regions: one with $(x,\theta) \approx (-.5, -.4)$,
% and one with $(x,\theta) \approx (.5, -.2)$.
% The central white regions have an interesting interpretation:
% if the needle is balanced on top of a mountain, then moving it
% left or right, or tilting it, doesn't have much effect.

%%
% Zooming in confirms this picture:
tic, x = linspace(-0.8,0.6,npts); theta = linspace(-0.5,0,npts);
[xx,thth] = meshgrid(x,theta); yy = 0*xx;
for k = 1:length(x)
  for j = 1:length(theta)
    yy(j,k) = minfun(xx(j,k),thth(j,k));
  end
end
levels = 0.06:.003:0.12;
contour(x,theta,yy,levels), grid on, xlabel('x',FS,14), ylabel('theta',FS,14)
title(['min value on grid: ' num2str(min(min(yy)))],FS,14), toc

%%
% The winner seems to be the region on the right.
% From here the right thing to do is call a bivariate optimization
% routine. In basic Matlab the simplest one is the direct
% search code
% |<http://www.mathworks.co.uk/help/matlab/ref/fminsearch.html fminsearch>|.
% This requires the input to be a
% single vector, so we'll need a wrapper:

function y = minfunwrapper(xvec)
y = minfun(xvec(1),xvec(2));
end

%%
% Here goes.
opts = optimset('tolx',1e-14,'display','off');
guess = [.41, -0.2];
tic, [xvec,yval] = fminsearch(@minfunwrapper,guess,opts); toc

%%
% So it would seem that to 10 digits or more, the minimal
% height is around
yval

%%
% Here is a closeup of the solution:
plotneedle(xvec(1),xvec(2)), hold on
axis equal, axis([-2 2 -.4 1.2])
plot(xvec(1),yval,'.k',MS,12), grid on

end
