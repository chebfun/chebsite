%% 1. 1D Chebfun solution
% The Chebfun example "The Rosenbrock function in 2D optimization"
% shows how Chebfun can be used to minimize a function of two variables
% over a rectangle.  The present example is adapted from that one, and simply
% considers another function investigated by Dixon and Szego in 1975:
f = @(x,y) (4-2.1*x.^2+ x.^4/3).*x.^2 + x.*y + 4*(y.^2-1).*y.^2;

%%
% Over the rectangle $[-2,2] \times [-1.25,1.25]$, the function looks like this:
LW = 'linewidth'; FS = 'fontsize'; MS = 'markersize';
x = linspace(-2,2); y = linspace(-1.25,1.25);
[xx,yy] = meshgrid(x,y); ff = f(xx,yy);
figure, contour(x,y,ff,30,LW,1.2), colorbar
axis([-2 2 -1.25 1.25]), hold on

%%
% Here is Chebfun code taken from opt/Rosenbrock.m to find the minimum and
% plot the point where it is attained. (The minimum is actually achieved at
% two points, because of symmetry, but Chebfun does not detect this.)
tic
fminx0 = @(x0) min(chebfun(@(y) f(x0,y),[-1.25 1.25]));
fminx = chebfun(fminx0,[-2 2],'vectorize','splitting','on');
[minf,minx] = min(fminx)
[minf,miny] = min(chebfun(@(y) f(minx,y), [-1 3]))
toc
plot(minx,miny,'.k',MS,20)

%% 2. Chebfun2 solution
% The above discussion was state-of-the-art Chebfun in 2010,
% but later it became more convenient and faster to solve such a problem
% with Chebfun2, as shown in 
% the Chebfun example "The Rosenbrock function in 2D optimization
% (revisited)".  Let us do likewise for this Dixon-Szego example.
% We can simply write
tic
F = chebfun2(f,[-2,2,-1.25,1.25]);
[minf,minx] = min2(F)
toc

%%
% And here is a plot.  Chebfun2 has made an arbitrary choice
% between the two equal global minima.
hold off
contour(F,30,LW,1.2), colorbar, axis([-2 2 -1.25 1.25])
hold on, plot(minx(1),minx(2),'.k',MS,20)
