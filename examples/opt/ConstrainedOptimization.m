%% One-dimensional constrained optimization
% By virtue of Chebfun's capabilities with global rootfinding and global
% optimization, some constrained optimization is possible. For example, for
% $x\in[0,10]$, solve 
%
%  $$\max( \sin(x)^2 + \sin(x^2) ) \quad \text{s.t.}\quad
% \lfloor x\rfloor = \text{prime}.$$
%

objective = chebfun( @(x) sin(x).^2 + sin(x.^2), [0 10] ); 
constrain = 0*x; 
p = primes( 10 ); 
for j = 1:length(p)
    constrain = constrain + ((p(j)<x) + (x<(p(j) + 1))-1); 
end

%% 
% Here, to deal with the simple constraint on the independent variable a
% characteristic function was constructed and multiplied with the objective
% function. 

%% Another constraint
% A similar thing can be done with other constraints.  
% For example, consider, for $x\in[0,10]$,
%
% $$ \min(\sin(x)^2+\sin(x^2)) \quad \text{s.t.} \quad |\sin(10x)|<1/2.$$
%

x = chebfun('x', [0 10]); 
objective = chebfun( @(x) sin(x).^2 + sin(x.^2), [0 10] ); 
constrain = (abs(sin(10*x)) < 1/2); 
g = objective.*constrain; 
[mx, loc] = max( g );
plot(g), hold on, plot(loc, mx, 'r.', MS, ms), hold off
title(sprintf('constrained maximum = %1.3f', mx),FS,fs), set(gca,FS,fs)

%% Two-dimensional constrained optimization
% Chebfun2 also has capabilities for global rootfinding and optimization
% and hence, also some constrained optimization. For example, consider maximizing 
% 
% $$\cos((x-1/10)y)^2 + x \sin(3x+y)$$ 
%
% over the following heart-shaped region:
  
t = chebfun('t',[0,2*pi]);
x = 2*sin(t); y = 2*cos(t)-(1/2)*cos(2*t)-(1/4)*cos(3*t)-(1/8)*cos(4*t);
constrain = x + 1i*y; 
plot( constrain, 'k-', LW, lw), axis equal, title('Constraint', FS, fs)

%%
% Here is a contour plot of the objective function: 

objective = chebfun2(@(x,y) cos((x-.1).*y).^2 + x.*sin(3*x+y), [-3 3 -3 3]); 

contour(objective, LW, lw), axis equal, hold on
plot( constrain, 'k-', LW, lw), set(gca, FS, fs)
axis([-3 3 -3 3])

%%
% We can solve this by first finding all the local extrema of the objective
% function, restricting to those that lie inside the heart-shaped region, and
% then picking the maximum:

r = roots( grad( objective ) ); 
idx = inpolygon(r(:,1), r(:,2), constrain );
r = r(idx,:); 
plot(r(:,1), r(:,2), '.k', MS, ms)
max_inside = max(objective(r(:,1), r(:,2)));
max_boundary = max(objective(constrain));
max_overall = max(max_inside, max_boundary)

%% 
% The maximum occurs inside the heart-shaped region. Let's plot it: 

[ignored, loc] = max(objective(r(:,1), r(:,2)));
plot( r(loc,1), r(loc,2), 'r.', MS, 40)
title(sprintf('Overall maximum = %1.3f', max_overall), FS, fs)

%% Humble comment
% The reason that Chebfun and Chebfun2 are able to perform some constrained
% optimization is by virtue of global optimization. For large scale problems
% this approach quickly becomes too computationally expensive, and there is a 
% huge field of mathematics devoted to more efficient methods.

%% Inpolygon
% The script below is an overload of the INPOLYGON command in MATLAB. 
% Functionality may be added into a new release of Chebfun, in which case this 
% script will be removed. 

function [in,on] = inpolygon(x,y,p)
%INPOLYGON True for points inside or on a region with chebfun boundary.
%   IN = INPOLYGON(X, Y, P) returns a matrix IN the size of X and Y. IN(j,k) = 1
%   if the point (X(j,k), Y(j,k)) is either strictly inside or on the edge of
%   the region with boundary given by the chebfun P; otherwise IN(j,k) = 0.
%
%   [IN ON] = INPOLYGON(X, Y, P) returns a second matrix, ON, which is the size
%   of X and Y. ON(j,k) = 1 if the point (X(j,k), Y(j,k)) is on the edge of the
%   polygonal region; otherwise ON(i,j) = 0.

tol = 100*eps;
  
p = p(:); % concatenate to column chebfun. 
if ( all(abs(p(p.domain,'left') - p(p.domain,'right')) > 100*eps) )
    error('CHEBFUN:inpolygon:closed','Chebfun must form closed curve.');
end

pgon = 1;   %Is it a polygon?
for k = 1:numel(p.funs{:})
    if ( length(p.funs{k}) > 2 ), pgon = 0; break; end 
end

% If it is a polygon use MATLAB inbuilt INPOLYGON command.
if ( pgon )
    [in, on] = inpolygon( x, y, real(p.values{:}), imag(p.values{:}) );
    return
end

% Not a polygon. Use Cauchy residue theorem (winding numbers).  
in = zeros( numel(x), 1); on=in;
for k = 1:numel(x)
    if (~isempty(roots(p - x(k) - 1i*y(k))))  % Does the curve & point intersect?
        on(k) = 1;
    end
end

left = 1:numel(x); left = left(~on);      % If not on, is it in?
% count winding number
for k = left
    realp = real(p); 
    rts = roots(realp-x(k));              % Does curve cross vertical line?
    if (isempty(rts)), continue, end      % No cross -> not in.
    sgn = sign(imag(p(rts))-y(k));        % Are we above or below the point?
    way = diff(realp); 
    way = sign(way(rts));                 % Clockwise or counterclockwise?
    if ( abs(sum(sgn.*way)) > 1-tol ), in(k) = 1; end % Count up signs.
