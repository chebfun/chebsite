% In this example we discuss numerical analytic continuation into the 
% complex plane using the `ratinterp` command in order to approximate
% singularities of solutions to the Lorenz equations.

%% The Lorenz system in real time
% The Lorenz system is a system of ODEs first studied by Edward Lorenz in
% the 1960s as a simplified model of convection rolls in the upper
% atmosphere [2]. The system is as follows:
%
% $$\frac{dx}{dt} = 10(y-x) $$
%
% $$\frac{dy}{dt} = 28 x - y - xz, $$
%
% $$\frac{dz}{dt} = -{8\over 3}z + xy. $$
%

%%
% We can compute a numerical solution on the interval $[0,5]$ using Chebfun's
% overload of the MATLAB ODE solver, `ode113`:
opts = odeset('abstol',1e-13,'reltol',1e-13);
fun = @(t,u) [10*(u(2)-u(1)); 28*u(1)-u(2)-u(1)*u(3); u(1)*u(2)-(8/3)*u(3)];
u = chebfun.ode113(fun,[0,5],[-14 -15 20], opts);

%%
% The solution can be viewed as an autonomous dynamical system in three
% dimensions, so we plot the trajectory:
LW = 'linewidth'; FS = 'fontsize';
plot3(u(:,1),u(:,2),u(:,3), LW, 1.6), view(20,20)
axis([-20 20 -40 40 5 45]), grid on
xlabel 'x(t)', ylabel 'y(t)', zlabel 'z(t)'

%%
% We can also view solutions as three interrelated scalar-valued functions
% of time:
plot(u, LW, 1.6)
grid on, xlabel 't', ylabel 'x(t), y(t), z(t)'

% Here as usual in MATLAB, $x$, $y$ and $z$ are coloured blue, green and red
% respectively. 

%% The Lorenz system in complex time
% In "Complex singularities and the Lorenz attractor" [3],
% Viswanath and Sahutoglu make the point
% that although the Lorenz attractor is a well known example in
% applied mathematics, relatively little is known about its mathematical
% analysis. It is suggested that a natural way to view the analysis is as a
% problem in analytic function theory, considering time as a complex 
% variable.

%%
% Solutions to the Lorenz system can be written locally in the form of
% a Psi-series. A Psi-series centred at $t_0$ in the complex plane is a 
% series of the form:
%
% $$ \sum_{j = -J}^\infty P_j(\eta)(t-t_0)^j, \quad \eta = \log(b(t-t_0)), $$
%
% where $J$ is an integer, $P_j$ is a polynomial and $b$ is a complex
% number with $|b| = 1$.

%%
% It is shown that the Lorenz system admits Psi-series solutions of the
% form:
%
% $$ x(t) = \qquad \qquad \quad \frac{P_{-1}(\eta)}{t-t_0} + P_0(\eta) +
% P_1(\eta)(t-t_0) + P_2(t-t_0)^2 + \ldots, $$
%
% $$ y(t) = \frac{Q_{-2}(\eta)}{(t-t_0)^2} + \frac{Q_{-1}(\eta)}{t-t_0} +
% Q_0(\eta) + Q_1(\eta)(t-t_0) + Q_2(t-t_0)^2 + \ldots, $$
%
% $$ z(t) = \frac{R_{-2}(\eta)}{(t-t_0)^2} + \frac{R_{-1}(\eta)}{t-t_0} +
% R_0(\eta) + R_1(\eta)(t-t_0) + R_2(t-t_0)^2 + \ldots, $$

%%
% valid in some disc centred at $t_0$ with a branch cut removed. 

%% 
% Asymptotically, the singularities behave like poles of orders
% 1, 2 and 2 for $x$, $y$ and $z$ respectively, because the logarithmic
% terms are "overpowered" in the limit as $t \rightarrow t_0$. A rational
% approximation is therefore appropriate for computing the locations of
% the singularities.

%% Analytic continuation via rational interpolation
% We can compute a rational interpolant of the solution using `ratinterp`,
% which actually computes a least squares approximation to the
% interpolation problem, removing poles that are likely to be spurious
% [1, Sec. 2]. The following command computes rational fits of
% types $(m, n) = (226,40)$, $(248,40)$ and $(242,40)$, where $m$ is the degree
% of the numerator and $n$ is the degree of the denominator:
[p1,q1,r1,mu1,nu1,poles1] = ratinterp(u(:,1),221,40, 444, [], 1e-12);
[p2,q2,r2,mu2,nu2,poles2] = ratinterp(u(:,2),241,40, 484, [], 1e-12);
[p3,q3,r3,mu3,nu3,poles3] = ratinterp(u(:,3),236,40, 473, [], 1e-12);

%%
% Here we have taken $m$ to be half the degree of the chebfun $u$ and $n$ 
% to be a number greater than the number of singularities we expect to find. 
% We don't actually expect to find 40 singularities, because `ratinterp` will
% reduce the degree of the numerator automatically to avoid extra unwanted 
% poles.

%%
% Here we have a contour plot of the rational approximants $r_1$,
% $r_2$, $r_3$, 
% computed by `ratinterp` with the computed locations of singularities 
% plotted as black crosses:

xx = linspace(-0.5,5.5,200);
yy = linspace(-0.5,0.5,200);
[XX,YY] = meshgrid(xx,yy);
z = XX+1i*YY;

subplot(3,1,1)
contour(xx,yy,abs(r1(z)), 0:5:150);
grid on, hold on

MS = 'markersize';
plot(poles1, 'xk', MS, 16, LW, 1.6)
plot([0,5],[0,0],'k',LW,1.6)

subplot(3,1,2)
contour(xx,yy,abs(r2(z)), 0:5:150);
grid on, hold on
title('r2(t)')
plot(poles2, 'xk', MS, 16, LW, 1.6)
plot([0,5],[0,0],'k',LW,1.6)

subplot(3,1,3)
contour(xx,yy,abs(r3(z)), 0:5:150);
grid on, hold on
title('r3(t)')
plot(poles3, 'xk', MS, 16, LW, 1.6)
plot([0,5],[0,0],'k',LW,1.6) 

%%
% The singularities are very close to the real line, demonstrating that the
% behaviour of the solution on the real line is intimately related to its 
% complex singularities. On the other hand, it has been proven that the imaginary 
% parts of any singularity of the Lorenz attractor must have absolute value
% greater than $0.037$ [3].

%%
% Note that by the Psi-series formula, each of $x$, $y$ and $z$ should have
% the same singularities. Let's compare our computed values to obtain a 
% lower bound on the error. The first column in the following contains the 
% computed locations of the singularities of $x$, the second those of $y$ 
% and the third those of $z$; the final column is the maximum separation in
% absolute value of these computed locations:

format short
diff = sort([abs(poles1-poles2),abs(poles1-poles3),abs(poles2-poles3)]);
disp('   poles in x         poles in y         poles in z         max. difference') 
disp([poles1, poles2, poles3, diff(:,1)])

%% 
% Let $t_0$ denote the location of a singularity and $t_w$ the worst 
% of our three approximations of it, $t_1$, $t_2$, $t_3$. Then we have 
% for $i,j = 1,2,3$:
%
% $$ |t_i - t_j| \leq |t_0 - t_i| + |t_0- t_j| \leq 2|t_0-t_w|. $$

%%
% Hence our worst case error for each pole is at least the following:
0.5*diff(:,1)'

%%
% It is remarkable that with just 6 lines of Chebfun we have been able to solve 
% the Lorenz system, find rational approximations, then compute the location
% of their poles by finding the roots of the denominator. Considering this,
% the agreement we see here is not bad, although it would be desirable to have 
% better.

%% `ratinterp` tolerance parameter
% The final argument in `ratinterp` is a tolerance parameter, which we set to
% $10^{-12}$ above. This affects which poles are removed from the approximant
% [Sec. 2, 1]. The higher the tolerance, the more poles are removed by
% `ratinterp`. Here is what happens when this robustness is not used at all
% (tolerance = 0):
[p,q,r,mu,nu,poles] = ratinterp(u(:,1),221,40, 444, [], 0);
poles

%%
% There are many unwanted, spurious poles. They are paired with roots of 
% the numerator, but only up to machine precision, so they don't actually
% cancel each other out. These are sometimes called _Froissart doublets_, 
% for the astrophysicist Marcel Froissart.
