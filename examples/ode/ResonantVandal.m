% In Problem 3.1.4 of their book _Ordinary Differential Equations_ [1],
% Carrier and Pearson present the following narrative:
%%
% _``A mathematically minded vandal wishes to break a steam radiator away
% from its foundations, but finds that when he applies steadily the
% greatest force of which he is capable [ $100$ kg] the $2$-cm displacement of
% the top of the radiator is only one-tenth of that required for his
% purposes.  He finds, however, that he can apply a force $f(t)$ according
% to the schedule
%
% $$ f(t) =  (1-\cos(\omega t)) \times 50\hbox{ kg} $$
%
% for any of a large range of values of $\omega$.  The mass of the radiator is
% $50$ kg and its foundation resists its movement by a force proportional to
% its displacement.  At what frequency and for how long must he exert the
% force $f(t)$ if he is to succeed?''_

%%
% Well, the vandal clearly has to find the natural frequency of the system
% and then pump it at that frequency to exploit resonance, just like
% pumping up a swing.  To solve the problem, we note that the total force
% on the radiator is
%
% $$ [(1-\cos(\omega t)) - d\,] \times 50\hbox{ kg}, $$ 
%
% where $d(t)$ is the distance of the radiator from its rest position in
% centimeters.  Since $50$ kg is also conveniently the mass of the
% radiator, Newton's law $F=ma$ gives us the equation $$ d'' + d = 1 -
% \cos(\omega t) $$ for the displacement as a function of $t$. From the
% $d'' + d$ terms we see that the natural frequency of this system is $1$,
% so the vandal should do his business at frequency $\omega = 1$.

%%
% Carrier and Pearson expect an analytic solution, which is not hard to
% determine; the amplitude will grow linearly with $t$.  But here of course
% we will do it with Chebfun.  We solve the ODE, and then solve the
% equation $d=20$ to find the breakaway time:
L = chebop(@(t,d) diff(d,2) + d - (1-cos(t)),[0 50]);
L.lbc = @(d) [d-2; diff(d)];
LW = 'linewidth';
d = L\0; plot(d,LW,1.6), grid on
xlabel('t (secs)'), ylabel('d (cm)'), axis([0 50 -30 30])
hold on, plot([0 50],[20 20],'--r',LW,2)
r = roots(d-20);
breakaway_time = r(1)
plot(breakaway_time,d(breakaway_time),'.r','markersize',28)
title(['Breakaway time = ' num2str(breakaway_time)],'fontsize',14)

%%
% So the vandal does his damage in 42 seconds. This is a very impressive
% young man, but I think he could apply his talents more constructively.

%%
% By the way, how close does the vandal come to achieving the breakaway
% condition $d=20$ one cycle earlier?  Here's the answer:
max(d{35,40})
